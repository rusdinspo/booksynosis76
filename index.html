The classroom was dark and dreary, and James knew everything outside was more exciting than anything he'd find inside.<br><br>But his teacher taught him otherwise. <br><br>"We make our own light here," Reverend Meachum told James. <br><br>And through hard work and learning, they did, until their school was shut down by a new law forbidding African American education in Missouri. Determined to continue teaching his students, Reverend John Berry Meachum decided to build a new school-a floating school in the Mississippi River, just outside the boundary of the unjust law.<br><br>Based on true events, Ron Husband's uplifting illustrations bring to life Deborah Hopkinson's tale of a resourceful, determined teacher; his bright, inquisitive students; and their refusal to accept discrimination based on the color of their skin.</p><p>Deborah Hopkinson is the author of more than forty-five books for young readers including picture books, short fiction, and nonfiction.

James and his sister attend school in the basement of a church. The secretive space is lit only by candles, but Reverend John, the teacher, tells James, "We make our own light here." A state law passed in 1847, however, makes it illegal to have any kind of school for "negroes or mulattoes," slave or free. Historical fiction based on the life of John Berry Meachum, the story describes how Reverend John got around the law by building a steamboat and holding classes on the Mississippi River, which was considered federal property. Husband, the first African American animator at Disney Studios, creates expressive illustrations that have the look and feel of the time period. Rendered mostly in brown and black tones, his detailed, cross-hatching style has the appearance of pen and ink. An author's note shares more of Meachum's life, describing how he worked in a mine to make enough money to buy freedom for himself and his father. Walking from Kentucky to Missouri, Meachum then worked as a carpenter and cooper in order to purchase his wife's and children's freedom. VERDICT Full of action and accomplishment, the story of James and Reverend John will impress and inspire readers. A powerful, well-written story to share with a class or with proficient readers.&#x2014;Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</p><h2>Collared: An Andy Carpenter Mystery (An Andy Carpenter Novel, 15)</h2><p><p>The next novel in David Rosenfelt&#x2019;s witty, heartfelt mystery series featuring lawyer Andy Carpenter and his faithful golden retriever, Tara.</p><p>Lawyer Andy Carpenter&#x2019;s true passion is the Tara Foundation, the dog rescue organization he runs with his friend Willie Miller. All kinds of dogs make their way to the foundation, and it isn&#x2019;t that surprising to find a dog abandoned at the shelter one morning, though it was accompanied by a mysterious anonymous note. But they are quite surprised when they scan the dog&#x2019;s embedded chip, and discover that they know this dog. He is the &#x201c;DNA dog.&#x201d;</p><p>Two and a half years ago, Jill Hickman was a single mother of an adopted baby. Her baby and dog were kidnapped in broad daylight in Eastside Park, and they haven&#x2019;t been seen since. A tip came in that ID&#x2019;d a former boyfriend of Hickman&#x2019;s, Keith Wachtel, as the kidnapper. A search of his house showed no sign of the child but did uncover more incriminating evidence, and the clincher that generated Wachtel&#x2019;s arrest was some dog hair, notable since Wachtel did not have a dog. DNA tests showed conclusively that the hair belonged to Hickman&#x2019;s dog. Wachtel was convicted of kidnapping, but the dog and baby were never found.</p><p>Now, with the reappearance of the dog, the case is brought back to light, and the search for the child renewed. Goaded by his wife&#x2019;s desire to help a friend and fellow mother and Andy&#x2019;s desire to make sure the real kidnapper is in jail, Andy and his team enter the case. But what they start to uncover is far more complicated and dangerous than they ever expected, in David Rosenfelt's <i>Collared.</i></p></p><p>DAVID ROSENFELT is the Edgar and Shamus Award-nominated author of several stand-alone books, as well as the Andy Carpenter novels, including <i>Unleashed</i>. After years living in California, he and his wife recently moved to Maine with the twenty-five golden retrievers that they've rescued. Rosenfelt's hilarious account of this cross-country move, <i>Dogtripping</i>, was published by St. Martin's Press in July 2013.<p>"Rosenfelt's matchless gift for feather-light exposition that hurtles along without ever feeling rushed or foggy allows him to keep the complications coming until nearly the end." <br>--<i> Kirkus Reviews</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"Faithful readers will find that Andy has lost none of his sardonic wit and cynical view. Rosenfelt structures chapters to keep the pages turning."<br>--<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"Smart plot twists ensue, and everyone--Andy, Laurie, and readers--are all the happier for it." <br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to Python: Best Practices for Development</h2><p><p><i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python</i> takes the journeyman Pythonista to true expertise. More than any other language, Python was created with the philosophy of simplicity and parsimony.

Unlike other books for this audience, <i>The Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide</i> is light on reusable code and heavier on design philosophy, directing the reader to excellent sources that already exist.</p></p><p><p>Kenneth Reitz is the product owner of Python at Heroku and a member of the Python Software Foundation.

Following the shape of a human life, beginning with birth and ending with death, it combines theoretical concepts and reflective learning to help your students develop an understanding of what makes us grow and change over our lives.<br> <br> <strong>The NEW Online Case Study Resource - Tangled Webs</strong><br> Now you and your students can explore key issues and themes raised in the book and develop the skill of linking theory to practice with free access to a new online case study resource. By following the lives of people living in the fictional London Borough of Bexford, this series of interlinked and extended case studies will allow your students to explore complex situations, much as they might do as practitioners in their working lives, and consider what ideas about Human Growth and Development might inform their thinking and practice.</p><p><p>Chris Beckett qualified as a social worker in the 1980s, and worked in the field for 18 years, first as a social worker and then as a manager, latterly as the manager of a children and families social work team.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most social workers who qualified at that time, he started out as a &#x2018;generic&#x2019; social worker, working with a range of service users including children and families, old people, and people with mental health problems and disabilities, but his predominant area of work was with children and families.</p><p>He moved into academic social work in 2000, working first at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge and then at the University of East Anglia in Norwich.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his social work text books, he has published academic articles on a variety of topics including the use of military language in social work, the importance of realism as an ethical principle, and statistics from Sweden about child abuse, following the legal ban there on corporal punishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;His main research area, however, has been decision-making in court proceedings about children, and decision-making about children more generally.</p><p>Chris has a parallel career as a writer of literary science fiction. (More information about his fiction can be found at&nbsp;www.chris-beckett.com.)&nbsp; He won the Edge Hill Short Fiction prize for his story collection, The Turing Test, and the Arthur C. Clarke award for his novel Dark Eden.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is now a full-time writer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His view is that &#x2018;academic&#x2019; and &#x2018;creative&#x2019; writing have more in common than might at first sight appear: in both cases the author begins with a jumble of ideas that seem to him to be in some way linked together, and attempts, in large part by a combination of intuition and trial and error, to impose some shape and structure.</p><p>Chris has three adult children, and lives in Cambridge with his wife Maggie and sundry animals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To comprehend applied theory, social work students need clear explanations and illustrative real-world examples. Beckett and Taylor successfully achieve this throughout their book and online content. Indeed, the addition of the online material <em>Tangled Webs</em> is a stroke of brilliance. Real lives are complex and interconnected; and this is expounded in the narrative of a fictional community, presented from diverse perspectives.</p> <br> Author: Lesley Deacon<br><br><p>This book is an excellent resource for students and tutors interested in how human beings learn and develop, and it is further enhanced through access to the Tangled Webs case studies. They are rich and diverse requiring the reader to challenge their assumptions and reflect on practice; thus supporting multi-professional development.</p> <br> Author: Samantha McMahon</p><h2>Turkey Hunting: A One Man Game</h2><p>TURKEY HUNTING, A ONE MAN GAME, by Ken Morgan, is a hardback, color edition (1987) that recalls a lifetime of hunting lessons. This turkey hunting book lays out some blueprints for all aspects of wild turkey hunting and sprinkles the reader with generous doses of facts. The author has also included a memorization chart that details the best turkey calling sounds to make in each hunting circumstance, and the area of our attitudes and values in turkey hunting is addressed. In addition, the author's appealing storytelling style, as well as his well-founded observations &amp; insights into wild turkey behavior and biology, make Kenny Morgan's book one that you will want to read again and again. Anyone with a passion for the hunt will benefit from this turkey hunting book. "A minor classic that many herald as being among the finest treatments of the sport's spirit." Jim Casada, Outdoor Writer</p><p>KENNY MORGAN (1946&#x2013;2011) was an author, science teacher, and naturalist. He was celebrated in turkey hunting circles for his vast knowledge of wild turkey behavior gathered from decades of observation and experience in the field. He authored America, Wild Turkeys &amp; Mongrel Dogs: Life Lessons from a Hunting Master. As a memoir, Morgan&#x2019;s collection of essays of wisdom &amp; wit recalls turkey hunting stories, and invites readers to standards for reviving small community values in America. Published posthumously by his wife, Sally Stuart Morgan in 2014 in a coffee table format with lush photography of wildlife &amp; Southern landscapes, Morgan's writing is a celebration of the joy that is all around us, especially in the outdoors. Morgan penned Turkey Hunting: A One Man Game, a popular classic technique book in 1987, and received a patent in 1973 for The Morgan Caller, selling more than 10,000 of his custom wild turkey callers. Kenny was revered as a skilled hunter who shared the gospel of the sport -- and love of the Creation--with a sizable community of brethren. A Louisiana native, Kenny spent his later years in College Station, Texas, with his wife Sally and their two children.</p><h2>Deadly</h2><p><b>Join the search for Typhoid Mary in this early twentieth-century CSI.

A world without the physical me&#x2014;what will that look like? I&#x2019;ll seep down into the soil, become a plant, a tree; I&#x2019;ll be falling leaves, yellow, crunching under a child&#x2019;s feet until I am dust. Nothing. Gone. </p><p>Every September, the shivers come over me, thoughts of my brother&#x2019;s terrifying death, and the questions&#x2014;why did his short life end? Why do people have to die? </p><p>I write here, trying to explain, each word a stepping stone. These words illuminate my past; they bring me forward, to the future. They help me remember. </p><p>Without my writing, I would suffer an emptiness worse than I feel now. </p><p>Today there are great holes in me. I feel like a secret observer, separate from everything that goes on around me. Peering from my window just above the storefronts of this creaky building on Ludlow Street where I&#x2019;ve lived since the morning of my birth, I watch Mrs. Zanberger at the vegetable cart below. She argues with Miss Lara over the price of onions the way she does every Sunday. Behind her, Kat Radlikov drags her heavy skirt through the mud, her belly swollen, her husband hiding in the shadows of their rooms. In front of the grocer&#x2019;s, Ruth Schmidt smiles under her patched parasol at Izzy Moscowitz, who works too hard to notice her. I see the Feldman sisters from upstairs chasing each other through puddles like boys, with finally a morning free from the factory. Under the butcher&#x2019;s canopy, their mother talks with other mothers from the neighborhood, their faces dark with worry. </p><p>I know them, these girls and women, I&#x2019;ve seen their families grow, they&#x2019;ve seen mine get smaller. When I&#x2019;m in their company, I listen to them trade recipes and sewing tips, I smile at their gossip about each other, yet I can&#x2019;t find a word to add. My eyes get stuck on the sadness in their mouths, or their red, chapped hands, and suddenly I&#x2019;m imagining their lives&#x2014;what they dream about when no one is looking, or what they might be like with fewer children. The women talk around and over me; somehow I feel like I&#x2019;ll always be looking at them through a distant window. </p><p>Even at school, I feel this. When classes started this week, I had in my mind the birth I&#x2019;d attended with Marm the night before&#x2014;Sophie Gersh came due around midnight and her mother pounded at our door, her fear thrusting us from our beds. Marm and I rushed after the frightened woman, running full gallop the two blocks to her daughter&#x2019;s apartment, where the girl&#x2019;s husband stood outside wringing his hands, and she lay keening in the bedroom like a poor abandoned child. I took my place at the head of the bed, where I held Sophie&#x2019;s hand and wiped the sweat from her teary eyes and assured her the birth would be good, that all would come out as we planned. Below, Marm did her magic; Sophie&#x2019;s water broke, she was ready. Working together, the three of us encouraged her baby to come forth into this world. His birth happened easily, a miracle, one of those rare times when Marm and I can clean up the infant and hand him to his mother and happily return to our own beds. We napped an hour before rising to face the day, which was my first day of school. </p><p>My schoolmates kissed&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t see each other through the summer months; the girls had matured, their faces and bodies grown longer or fatter. I smiled at Josephine, who had become impossibly taller and thinner and prettier, and Fanny, whose round face had finally found its cheekbones. I brushed their cheeks with my lips. I searched their eyes for the start to a conversation; I wanted to tell them about the birth, or Benny, but Josephine started talking about her new job at the perfume counter at Macy&#x2019;s. She described the glamorous ladies who bought the most expensive ounces, the delicate fabrics they wore, their jewels and dogs. She didn&#x2019;t stop until Mrs. Browning came in with stout Miss Ruben, our teacher for the year. My heart dropped when I saw it was her. Miss Ruben&#x2019;s eyes swept the room imperiously and settled on me. </p><p>She said, &#x201c;Girls, I see that some of you are still lacking in the most basic charms. We must correct that situation now. This is your last year before you are released into the world. There is no time left to waste!&#x201d; </p><p>I turned my eyes away from hers and concentrated on the smoke I could see puffing from the stack of the building next door. My stomach soured at the thought of spending my last year with her. Miss Ruben hasn&#x2019;t liked me since third grade. </p><p>At afternoon lunch, I sat in the common room nibbling on my potato knish, listening to Jo and Fanny, feeling as if my insides were made of India rubber and all their words bounced around without touching me. I again attempted to tell them about the beautiful boy whose birth I had witnessed that very morning, but Josephine&#x2019;s exuberant chatter drowned out my words before I could form them. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Fanny,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;goodness, I forgot to tell you I thought you looked simply darling at the cocoon tea! Where did you buy that sweet dress?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Feinstein&#x2019;s had a special sale,&#x201d; Fanny explained. &#x201c;I saw Dora there, and she convinced me to buy it. Did you hear her father caught her and Mr. Goldwaite holding hands in the back of his carriage? That man is too old for her!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He should pair with a dumpling like Miss Ruben, not a girl Dora&#x2019;s age!&#x201d; Josephine said. &#x201c;Have you noticed the way our teacher looks this year? That lip coloring is simply awful on her, don&#x2019;t you think? And doesn&#x2019;t she know gray jackets with heavy braids are out of fashion?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The way she looks at us,&#x201d; Fanny said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;d think she was the Queen of England!&#x201d; </p><p>The girls laughed, and I shook my head. I longed to be somewhere else, with someone else. I felt inside me that sore place of missing Anushka, and that silly flash of anger&#x2014;why has she left me alone? Every morning we&#x2019;d walk to school together, talking about everything under the sun. She&#x2019;d ask me what I dreamt and thought about. No one does that now. I wish she hadn&#x2019;t moved away last spring. In her letters from the farm, she writes about someone named Ida. I get a pang of fear when she writes of this girl. I hope Ida has not replaced me. Anushka said speaking to Ida was profound, like walking into a lake and suddenly discovering a drop-off into deeper water. </p><p>Oh, I simply ache to have a profound talk with another girl! I&#x2019;d tell her about Papa and Benny, how our life used to be. </p><p>I&#x2019;ve been sneaking into the temple to read notices on the B&#x2019;nai community board, those that are not in Hebrew. For our last year of school, we are allowed to work afternoons, but I can&#x2019;t imagine myself arranging flowers like Sara does at McLean&#x2019;s Fancy Florist, or using my feminine charms like Josephine to draw in customers at Macy&#x2019;s perfumery. Mrs. Browning says these sorts of jobs bring us closer to the class of people we strive to be someday, but I want serious employ. Not just for the money, though Marm and I do need it, but for the challenge to my mind. I want to be able to go somewhere and do something important and return home in the evening with soft bills in hand. Is it foolish to want a different type of job than Mrs. Browning trains us for, something more, something bigger than myself? </p><p>Truthfully, I hunger for a job that&#x2019;s meaningful. </p><p>� 2011 Julie Chibbaro </p></p><h2>Willin&#39;: The Story of Little Feat</h2><p>Formed in 1969 by ex-members of Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention, Little Feat created groove-heavy music that was an irresistible mix of rock, blues, R&amp;B, country, jazz, soul, and funk. Fronted by the doomed, enigmatic, and charismatic vocalist and slide guitarist Lowell George, they recorded such classic studio albums as <i>Sailin' Shoes</i> and <i>Dixie Chicken</i>, as well as what many consider to be one of the best live albums of all time: <i>Waiting for Columbus</i>. After George's tragic death in 1979 and a long period of silence, the band later re-formed in 1987, delighting concert crowds with tight renditions of their beloved songs, including their signature outlaw trucker anthem "Willin'."<br><br>Acclaimed journalist Ben Fong-Torres, working with surviving band members and their friends and associates, has based <i>Willin'</i> on hours of brand-new interviews with all the key players, resulting in the definitive, first-ever biography of this beloved rock 'n' roll institution.<br></p><p><b>Ben Fong-Torres</b> is a journalist, author, and broadcaster, best known for his work in <i>Rolling Stone</i> and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>.

Each title focuses on three different word families. <i>Pig</i> looks at words containing the letter combinations ig, ug, and at, while <i>Snake</i> features ake, oat, and ant. Peek-through pages transform illustrations to match the changing consonants (e.g., jig becomes dig). While most of the pages feature only one or two words, the last page of each section is a review of all the words from the family. The bright, flat illustrations outlined in black are reminiscent of the artwork in Dick Bruna's Miffy books (Kodansha America), but are more colorful. These titles could be used with beginner readers or as an introduction to rhyming words. Each one includes a page about word families that adults might find helpful. The appealing cartoon covers and die-cut pages guarantee circulation.<i>&#x2013;Danielle Nicole Du Puis, Forest Ridge Elementary School, Laurel, MD</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I touch the keyboard, and a photo of Paul appears on my screen. It&#x2019;s the one I took of him in Rome on our honeymoon, eyes full of love across a table in the Campo dei Fiori. I try to smile back at him but as I lean in, I catch a glimpse of my reflection in the screen and stop. I hate seeing myself without warning. Don&#x2019;t recognize myself sometimes. You think you know what you look like and there is this stranger looking at you. It can frighten me.</p><p>But today I study the stranger&#x2019;s face. The brown hair half pulled up on top of the head in a frantic work bun, naked skin, shadows and lines creeping towards the eyes like cracks in pavement.</p><p>&#x201c;Christ, you look awful,&#x201d; I tell the woman on the screen. The movement of her mouth mesmerizes me and I make her speak some more.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, Emma, get some work done,&#x201d; she says. I smile palely at her and she smiles back.</p><p>&#x201c;This is mad behavior,&#x201d; she tells me in my own voice, and I stop. Thank God Paul can&#x2019;t see me now, I think.</p><p>When Paul gets home tonight, he&#x2019;s tired and a bit grumpy after a day of &#x201c;boneheaded&#x201d; undergraduates and another row with his department head over the timetable.</p><p>Maybe it&#x2019;s an age thing, but it seems to really shake Paul to be challenged at work these days. I think he must be starting to doubt himself, see threats to his position everywhere. University departments are like prides of lions, really. Lots of males preening and screwing around and hanging on to their superiority by their dewclaws. I say all the right things and make him a gin and tonic.</p><p>When I move his briefcase off the sofa, I see he&#x2019;s brought home a copy of the Evening Standard. He must&#x2019;ve picked it up on the tube.</p><p>I sit and read it while he showers away the cares of the day, and it&#x2019;s then I see the paragraph about the baby.</p><p>&#x201c;Baby&#x2019;s Body Found,&#x201d; it says. Just a few lines about how an infant&#x2019;s skeleton has been discovered on a building site in Woolwich and police are investigating. I keep reading it over and over. I can&#x2019;t take it in properly, as if it&#x2019;s in a foreign language.</p><p>But I know what it says and terror is coiling around me. Squeezing the air out of my lungs. Making it hard to breathe.</p><p>I am still sitting here when Paul comes down, all damp and pink, and shouting that something is burning.</p><p>The pork chops are black. Incinerated. I throw them in the bin and open the window to let out the smoke. I fetch a frozen pizza out of the freezer and put it in the microwave while Paul sits quietly at the table.</p><p>&#x201c;We ought to get a smoke alarm,&#x201d; he says instead of shouting at me for almost setting the house on fire. &#x201c;Easy to forget things when you&#x2019;re reading.&#x201d; He is such a lovely man. I don&#x2019;t deserve him.</p><p>Standing in front of the microwave, watching the pizza revolve and bubble, I wonder for the millionth time if he&#x2019;ll leave me. He should have done years ago. I would have if I&#x2019;d been in his place, having to deal with my stuff, my worries, on a daily basis. But he shows no sign of packing his bags. Instead he hovers over me like an anxious parent, protecting me from harm. He talks me down when I get in a state, invents reasons to be cheerful, holds me close to calm me when I cry, and tells me I am a brilliant, funny, wonderful woman.</p><p>It is the illness making you like this, he says. This isn&#x2019;t you.</p><p>Except it is. He doesn&#x2019;t know me really. I&#x2019;ve made sure. And he respects my privacy when I shy at the mention of my past. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to tell me,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I love you just the way you are.&#x201d;</p><p>Saint Paul&#x2014;I call him that when he&#x2019;s pretending I&#x2019;m not a burden to him, but he usually shushes me.</p><p>&#x201c;Hardly,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>Well, not a saint, then. But who is? Anyway, his sins are my sins. What do old couples say? What&#x2019;s yours is mine. But my sins&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, they&#x2019;re my own.</p><p>&#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you eating, Em?&#x201d; he says when I put his plate on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;I had a late lunch, busy with work. I&#x2019;m not hungry now, but I&#x2019;ll have something later,&#x201d; I lie. I know I would choke if I put anything in my mouth.</p><p>I give my brightest smile&#x2014;the one I use for photos. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Paul. Now eat up.&#x201d;</p><p>On my side of the table, I nurse a glass of wine and pretend to listen to his account of the day. His voice rises and falls, pauses while he chews the disgusting meal I&#x2019;ve served, and resumes.</p><p>I nod periodically but I hear nothing. I wonder if Jude has seen the article.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Kate</p><p>Tuesday, March 20, 2012</p><p>Kate Waters was bored. It wasn&#x2019;t a word she normally associated with her job, but today she was stuck in the office under the nose of her boss with nothing to do but rewrites.</p><p>&#x201c;Put it through your golden typewriter,&#x201d; Terry, the news editor, had shouted across, waving someone else&#x2019;s badly written story at her. &#x201c;Sprinkle a bit of fairy dust on it.&#x201d;</p><p>And so she did.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like an assembly line in here,&#x201d; she complained to the Crime Man, sitting opposite. &#x201c;Churning out the same old rubbish with a few frills. What are you working on?&#x201d;</p><p>Gordon Willis, whom the Editor always referred to by his job title&#x2014;as in &#x201c;Get the Crime Man on this story&#x201d;&#x2014;lifted his head from a newspaper and shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;Going down to the Old Bailey this afternoon&#x2014;want to have a chat with the detective chief inspector in the crossbow murder. Nothing doing yet but hoping I might get a talk with the victim&#x2019;s sister when it finishes. Looks like she was sleeping with the killer.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be a great multi-deck headline: &#x2018;The Wife, the Sister and the Killer They Both Loved,&#x2019;&#x201d; he said and grinned at the thought. &#x201c;Why? What have you got on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. Unpicking a story one of the online slaves has done.&#x201d; Kate indicated a pubescent nymph typing furiously at a desk across the room. &#x201c;Straight out of school.&#x201d;</p><p>She realized how bitter&#x2014;and old&#x2014;she must sound and stopped herself. The tsunami of online news had washed her and those like her to a distant shore. The reporters who once sat on the Top Table&#x2014;the newspaper equivalent of the winner&#x2019;s podium&#x2014;now perched at the edge of the newsroom, pushed farther and farther towards the exit by the growing ranks of online operatives who wrote twenty-four/seven to fill the hungry maw of rolling news.</p><p>New media stopped being new a long time ago, the Editor had lectured his staff at the Christmas party. It was the norm. It was the future. And she knew she had to stop bitching about it.</p><p>Hard, she told herself, when the most viewed stories on the paper&#x2019;s slick website are about Madonna&#x2019;s hands being veiny or an EastEnders star putting on weight. &#x201c;Hate a Celebrity&#x201d; dressed as news. Horror.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; she said out loud, &#x201c;it can wait. I&#x2019;ll go and get us a coffee.&#x201d;</p><p>Also gone were the days of the CQ&#x2014;the conference quickie&#x2014;once enjoyed by Fleet Street&#x2019;s finest in the nearest pubs while the executives were in the Editor&#x2019;s morning meeting. The CQ was traditionally followed by red-faced, drunken rows with the news editor, one of which, legend had it, ended with a reporter, too drunk to stand, biting his boss&#x2019;s ankle and another throwing a typewriter through a window into the street below.</p><p>The newsroom, now in offices above a shopping mall, had windows hermetically sealed by double glazing, and alcohol was banned. Coffee was the new addiction of choice.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Double macchiato with hazelnut syrup, please,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Or some brown liquid. Whichever comes first.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate took the lift down, pinching a first edition of the Evening Standard from the security desk in the marble lobby. As she waited for the barista to work his magic with the steamer, she flicked idly through the pages, checking for the bylines of friends.</p><p>The paper was wall-to-wall preparations for the London Olympics and she almost missed the paragraph at the bottom of the News in Brief column.</p><p>Headlined &#x201c;Baby&#x2019;s Body Found,&#x201d; two sentences told how an infant&#x2019;s skeleton had been unearthed on a building site in Woolwich, not a million miles from Kate&#x2019;s east London home. Police were investigating. No other details. She tore it out of the paper for later. The bottom of her bag was lined with crumpled scraps of newspapers&#x2014;&#x201c;it&#x2019;s like a budgie cage,&#x201d; her eldest son, Jake, had teased about the shreds of paper waiting for life to be breathed into them. Sometimes whole stories to be followed up on or, more often, just a line or a quote that made her ask, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the story?&#x201d;</p><p>Kate reread the thirty words and wondered about the person missing from the story: the mother. As she walked back with the cups, she ticked off her questions: Who is the baby? How did it die? Who would bury a baby?</p><p>&#x201c;Poor little thing,&#x201d; she said out loud. Her head was suddenly full of her own babies&#x2014;Jake and Freddie; born two years apart but known as &#x201c;the boys&#x201d; in family shorthand. Them as sturdy toddlers, schoolboys in football gear, surly teenagers, and now adults&#x2014;well, almost. She smiled to herself. Kate could remember the moment she saw each of them for the first time: red, slippery bodies; crumpled, too-big skin; blinking eyes staring up from her chest; and the feeling that she had known their faces forever. How could anyone kill a baby? she thought.</p><p>When she got back to the newsroom, she put the cups down and walked over to the news desk.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you mind if I have a look at this?&#x201d; she asked Terry, waving the tiny cutting in front of him as he tried to make sense of a feature on foreign royals. He didn&#x2019;t look up so she assumed he didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Her first call was to the Scotland Yard press office. When she&#x2019;d started in journalism, as a trainee on a local paper in East Anglia, she used to call in at the local police station every day to lean on the front desk and look at the logbook while the sergeant chatted her up. Now, if she contacted the police, she rarely spoke to a human being. And if she did, it was likely to be a fleeting experience.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you listened to the tape?&#x201d; a civilian press officer would ask, in the full knowledge that she hadn&#x2019;t, and she would find herself quickly rerouted to a tinny recorded message that took her through every stolen lawnmower and pub punch-up in the area.</p><p>But, this time, she hit the jackpot. It was not only a real person; it was someone she knew. The voice on the other end of the phone belonged to a former colleague from her first job on a national newspaper. He was one of the poachers turned gamekeepers who&#x2019;d recently joined the safer, some said saner, world of public relations.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Kate. How are you? Long time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Colin Stubbs wanted to chat. He&#x2019;d done well as a reporter, but his wife, Sue, had grown tired of his rackety life on the road and he&#x2019;d given in to the war of attrition at home. But he was hungry for details about the world he&#x2019;d left, asking for gossip about other reporters and telling her&#x2014;and himself&#x2014;over and over that leaving newspapers was the best thing he&#x2019;d ever done.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great. Lucky you,&#x201d; Kate said, determinedly upbeat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still slogging along at the Post. Look, Colin, I saw something in the Standard about a baby&#x2019;s body being found in Woolwich. Any idea how long it&#x2019;d been there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that. Hang on, I&#x2019;ll pull up the details on the computer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here we are. Not much to go on and a bit grim, really. A workman was clearing a demolition site and moved an old urn and underneath was this tiny skeleton. Newborn, they say. Forensics are having a look but it says here that early indications are it&#x2019;s been there awhile&#x2014;could be historic, even. It&#x2019;s a road in student land, towards Greenwich, I think. Don&#x2019;t you live round that area?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;North of the river and a bit farther east, actually. Hackney. And still waiting for the gentrification train to stop. What else have you got on your computer? Any leads on identification?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, newborns are tricky when it comes to DNA, says here. Especially if they&#x2019;ve been underground for years. And the area is a warren of rented flats and bedsits. Tenants changing every five minutes so the copper in charge isn&#x2019;t optimistic about it. We&#x2019;ve all got our hands full with the Olympics stuff&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, of course,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;The security must be a nightmare&#x2014;I hear you&#x2019;re having to bus in officers from other forces to cope. And this baby story sounds like a needle-in-a-haystack job. Look, thanks, Colin. It&#x2019;s been good to catch up. Give my love to Sue. And, Colin, will you give me a call if anything else comes up on this?&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled as she put down the phone. Kate Waters loved a needle-in-a-haystack job. The glint of something in the dark. Something to absorb her totally. Something to sink her teeth into. Something to get her out of the office.</p><p>She put on her coat and started the long walk to the lift. She didn&#x2019;t get far.</p><p>&#x201c;Kate, are you off somewhere?&#x201d; Terry shouted. &#x201c;Before you go, you couldn&#x2019;t untangle this stuff about the Norwegian royals, could you? It&#x2019;s making my eyes bleed.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Angela</p><p>Tuesday, March 20, 2012</p><p>She knew she was going to cry. She could feel it welling up, thickening her throat so she couldn&#x2019;t speak, and went to sit on the bed for a minute to postpone it. Angela needed to be on her own when it came. She&#x2019;d tried to fight it over the years&#x2014;she never cried, normally. She wasn&#x2019;t the sentimental sort&#x2014;nursing and living the army life had trained that out of her a long time ago.</p><p>But March 20 every year was the exception. It was Alice&#x2019;s birthday and she would cry. A private moment. She wouldn&#x2019;t dream of doing it in front of anyone, like the people who stood there and wept in front of cameras. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine what it felt like, to be on show like that. And the television people kept on filming as though it was some sort of entertainment.</p><p>&#x201c;They should turn off the camera,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said to Nick, but he&#x2019;d just grunted and kept on watching.</p><p>It made her feel uncomfortable but apparently lots of people liked it. The sort of people who tried to be part of everything in the news.</p><p>Anyway, she didn&#x2019;t think anyone would understand why she was still crying all these years later. Decades later. They&#x2019;d probably say she&#x2019;d hardly known the baby. She&#x2019;d had less than twenty-four hours with her.</p><p>&#x201c;But she was part of me. Flesh of my flesh,&#x201d; she told the skeptics in her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried to let go but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>The dread would begin in the days before the baby&#x2019;s birthday and she&#x2019;d get flashbacks to the silence. That bone-chilling silence in the empty room.</p><p>Then, on the day, she would usually wake up with a headache, would make breakfast, and try to act normally until she was alone. This year, she was talking to Nick in the kitchen about the day ahead. He&#x2019;d been complaining about the mountain of paperwork he had to deal with and about one of the new lads in the stores who kept taking days off sick.</p><p>He ought to retire&#x2014;he&#x2019;s coming up sixty-five, she thought. But he can&#x2019;t let go of the business. Neither of us can let go of things, I suppose. He says he needs...</p></p><h2>Father Browne&#39;s Titanic Album: A Passenger&#39;s Photographs and Personal Memoir</h2><p><br>As a passenger on the first two legs of Titanic's ill fated voyage, Father Francis Browne SJ's photographs are an immensely important record. As well as taking a unique set of photos, Father Browne also assembled an incredibly valuable album of Titanic material such as an original deck plan, menus, letters to him from fellow passengers, contemporary newspaper cuttings and other documents, many of which are reproduced here. <br><br>Thanks to the gift of a ticket from his uncle, a young Jesuit named Francis Browne travelled on the Titanic during her maiden voyage from Southampton, to Cherbourg to Cork. Invited to remain with the ship as it crossed the Atlantic, Fr Browne was saved from possible disaster by a telegram from his Jesuit superior ordering him to "get off that ship". When the unthinkable happened and the Titanic sank, Fr Browne's photographs appeared on the front pages of newspapers all around the world.<br><br>For many years the photographs of Fr Browne were forgotten until 1985 when Fr Eddie O'Donnell happened across an old tin trunk in the Jesuit archives and re-discovered 42,000 photographs, including the Titanic collection.</p><p>O&#39;Donnell is the sole curator of the vast collection of Father Browne photographs.&#34;One of the most remarkably evocative books on the ill-fated Titanic.&#34; -- Irish Voice &#34;Irish Voice&#34;</p><h2>Goat Song: A Seasonal Life, A Short History of Herding, and the Art of Making Cheese</h2><p><i>Goat Song</i> is the story of a year in the life of a couple who abandoned their one-bedroom apartment in New York City to live on seventy-five acres in Vermont and raise Nubian goats. In poetic, reverent detail, Brad Kessler explores our ancient relationship to the land and our gradual alienation from the animals that feed us. His fascinating account traces his journey of choosing the goats and learning how to breed, milk, and care for them. As Kessler begins to live the life of a herder, he encounters the pastoral roots of so many aspects of Western culture&#x2014;how our diet, our alphabet, our religions, poetry, and economy all grew out of a pastoralist setting, a life lived among hoofed animals.</p><p>Brad Kessler&#x2019;s novel Birds in Fall won the Dayton Literary Peace Prize.

The house sat at the head of a hollow -- wide-board floors, a rusted tin roof -- the last outpost before impassable mountains. You drove up a dirt road beside a murmuring creek and came to a cattle gate. When you hooked the gate again it felt like you were leaving the world behind. </p><p> I lived in Manhattan back then but never felt right in the city. I longed for fewer people and more trees. The rented farmhouse was an anodyne. Between semesters and on long weekends my wife, Dona, and I escaped to West Virginia. I adored the long drives, the eight-hour commute, the layers of Manhattan peeling away with each Mid-Atlantic state -- New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia. It felt like stripping out of formal attire; by the Alleghenies we were down to underwear. </p><p> We were about to shake hands on the West Virginia farmhouse when a phone call came one night. The seller had burned down the house. Turned out he never really owned the homeplace -- his sister did. He burned the house for spite. A family feud. An Appalachian story. The night the call came I mourned, convinced we'd never find such a perfect place again. </p><p> My whole life it seemed I'd been searching for a retreat in the mountains, a patch of land where I could grow my own food. I was a writer, Dona a photographer. We made our living -- our art -- with paper but we longed to make it with earth as well. Ever since reading <i>Walden</i> as a teen I'd nursed Thoreau's old dream of self-reliance, his cabin along the lake, his meticulous lists of peas and beans. I admired how he wove literary culture and agriculture into one fabric -- pen in one hand, hoe in the other -- and how he understood that alongside civil disobedience, the most active thing one could do on earth was produce one's own food. </p><p> For five years we searched for a home. We scoured the whole Northeast, looked at a hundred plots of land. One week a realtor called from Vermont. He'd found an eighteenth-century farmhouse on a dead-end road in the western part of the state. The asking price was absurdly low; the farmhouse had sat empty for years and nothing inside was expected to work. We might have to tear the place down, he confessed, and start anew. Yet the land was apparently stunning, worth the asking price alone. There was an orchard, a pond, outbuildings, a brook. Seventy-five acres of sheepland grown back to forest. </p><p> We drove there late one October afternoon when the trees had shed their leaves. The valley looked promising; narrow and forested with folded hills. An opalescent river tumbled aside the road. The pavement turned to gravel, then we jostled up a rocky drive and the house swung into view: bone white clapboards, mountains all around. We both knew right away. </p><p> This was over a decade ago. Back then neither of us knew much about animal husbandry (we'd both grown up in the suburbs). But soon Dona began photographing neighboring dairy farms and helping with chores; and that led to a familiarity -- a friendship -- with animals, particularly with goats. </p><p> This is the story of our first years with dairy goats. A story about what it's like to live with animals who directly feed you. I tell of cheese and culture and agriculture, but also of the rediscovery of a pastoral life. <i>Rediscovery</i> because the longer I lived with goats the more connections I saw to a collective human past we've since forgotten, here in North America at least. I saw how so many aspects of our everyday culture -- from our alphabet to our diet to elements of our economy and poetry -- arose from a lifestyle of herding hoofed animals, and how unbeknownst to most of us, pastoralism still informs so much of the way we live today. </p><p> Goats had intrigued me for years -- their intelligence, their seeming disdain of human dominion. I once trailed a herd of goats in India through the Thar Desert back to their homes at night. A herder led them into the walled city of Jaisalmer. The goats marched single file, hoofs clicking cobbles, while scooters and trucks squeezed past. At each narrow curve another doe broke from the parade and turned in to a home where a member of the household -- a child or a woman -- held open a wooden door and greeted the returning goat with a palmful of salt. The does had returned from the desert to be milked and bedded with their family at night. In the morning they'd gather again with the herder. I'd never seen such a wonderful arrangement before -- goats and humans living side by side -- but it was one of the most ancient continuous relationships between mammals. </p><p> In Vermont, Dona milked a neighbor's goats when the neighbor went away. She brought home the raw milk still warm in a glass bottle. I made a <i>queso blanco</i>, the simplest cheese in the world. (You heat the milk, add a spoonful of vinegar, and the curds separate from the whey like magic; drain the curds in a cheesecloth, let them drip for a few minutes and -- voil� -- you've made a cheese.) The <i>queso blanco</i> was tasty but a bit rubbery. When the neighbor went away again I tried my hand at making ch�vre. I had a small bottle of rennet and the right starter culture. The curds set up overnight and the next day I drained them in a cheesecloth. When we tried the fresh ch�vre the following afternoon, it tasted like nothing we'd ever eaten before -- a custard, a creamy pudding, the cheese so young and floral it held within its curd the taste of grass and herbs the goat had eaten the day before. It seemed we were eating not a cheese, but a meadow. </p><p> The French used to call cheese "the drunkard's biscuit." That afternoon we were intoxicated without drinking a thing. We devoured the creamy ch�vre smeared on slices of bread, ran fingers across the plate. We couldn't understand why it tasted so good. Was it the raw unpasteurized milk, or that we knew the goats -- their labor and ours? "Who has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from his food, in which appetite had no share?" wrote Thoreau. "I have been inspired through the palate." </p><p> That afternoon we decided: it was time to get our goats. </p><p> Copyright � 2009 by Brad Kessler</p></p><h2>How to Rebuild &amp; Modify Ford Flathead V-8 Engines (Motorbooks Workshop)</h2><p><p><b>The ultimate Ford flathead resource for hot rodders and restorers.</b></p><p>The last commercially produced Ford Flathead V-8 was cast over 60 years ago.

The Cold War is heating up; McCarthyism, in all its fear and demagoguery, is raging in the nation&#x2019;s capital, and Joseph Stalin&#x2019;s death has left a dangerous power vacuum in the Soviet Union.<br> <br> The CIA, meanwhile, is reeling from the discovery of a double agent within their midst. Someone is selling secrets to the Soviets, compromising missions and endangering lives around the globe. The CIA director knows any news of the traitor, whose code name is Protocol, would be a national embarrassment and weaken the entire agency. He assembles an elite team to find Protocol.<br> <br> George Mueller seems to be the perfect man to help the investigation: Yale-educated; extensive experience running missions in Eastern Europe; an operative so dedicated to his job that it left his marriage in tatters. Mueller, though, has secrets of his own, and as he digs deeper into the case, making contact with a Soviet agent, suspicion begins to fall on him, as well. Paranoia and fear spreads and until Protocol is found, no one can be trusted.</p><p>Paul Vidich has had a distinguished career in music and media.

He won&#x2019;t show.&#x201d; He ground his cigarette into the overflowing ash tray. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re wasting our time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll come. He can&#x2019;t resist the bait.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mueller looked across the icy street at the dilapidated apartment building separated from the sidewalk by a wrought iron fence. Bars protected first-floor windows. There was no activity and there hadn&#x2019;t been since he&#x2019;d arrived. A streetlamp at the corner cast its amber glow up the block, but it didn&#x2019;t reach the stoop. An unmarked car stood at Twelfth Street NE and Lincoln Park, and a black Buick was around the corner, in the alley, out of sight, but Mueller had seen it on his way over. Further up the block, an agent waited in the dimly lit phone booth, self-conscious with his newspaper.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been scared off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He has no reason to believe we&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t need a reason. It&#x2019;s instinct. Even an amateur would wonder why that man&#x2019;s been in the phone booth an hour. For you it&#x2019;s a job.&#x201d; Mueller dropped the curtain. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s his life. He knows.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mueller glanced at his watch. &#x201c;When do you call it quits?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s time. We spotted her making the drop at five. She&#x2019;s Chernov&#x2019;s wife. She went in the lobby with the package. She came out without it. He&#x2019;ll come.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure it was her?&#x201d; Mueller asked.<br> <br>He waited for FBI agent Walker to respond. Mueller thought Walker flamboyant, enjoying his status as agent-in-charge, eager to hunt. He dressed the part: dark hair combed straight back, polished shoes, double-breasted suit, and thin moustache like a Hollywood leading man. Through the window street sounds spilled into the darkened apartment&#x2014;a car&#x2019;s honk, a woman&#x2019;s anger. The agent raised opera glasses and scanned the street and then shifted his attention to the edge of Lincoln Park. Automobiles cruised single men sitting alone on wood benches. A giant mound of dirty snow from the weekend storm buried parked cars.<br> <br>&#x201c;We know it was her,&#x201d; Walker said in his drawl. &#x201c;We have surveillance. Two cars. She left the Soviet embassy, took a taxi to the residence, and walked here with the package. It&#x2019;s still inside.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mueller waited. He looked at his watch again, and then without thinking, he did it again. Waiting was the hardest part. He moved to the center of the room. There was the rank smell of cigarettes in the small apartment, half-drunk coffee cups, and the wilted remains of a take-out dinner. All waiting did was give him time to be irritated. He took a tennis ball from the table and squeezed it, working out his tension, squeezing and resqueezing. At another window he lifted the curtain. The street was dark, quiet, empty. Walker didn&#x2019;t understand that double agents lived in fear, chose their time, and that a cautious man wasn&#x2019;t going to take an unnecessary risk.<br> <br>Lights in the building across the street were dark except for a top-floor apartment. A big woman at the window pulled her sweater over her head and then reached behind to undo her bra. Mueller looked then glanced away. A light on the second floor. Had someone entered the building lobby? Through the window an older man stood in boxer shorts before an open refrigerator. He drank milk straight from a quart bottle and then he shuffled off to the kitchen table and sat by a console radio. Mueller looked back at the top floor, but the curtain was drawn.<br> <br>How long should he stay? Walker and his men wouldn&#x2019;t abandon the stakeout until long after it was an obvious bust. No one wanted to admit failure, or have to invent excuses. Mueller was officially just an observer.<br> <br>He saw a young man with a notepad approach from across the room. Crew-cut, freckled face, no tie, boyish smile. Too young for this type of assignment.<br> <br>&#x201c;You the CIA guy?&#x201d; the young man asked.<br> <br>Mueller narrowed his brow. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Star.&#x201d; He lifted the press badge hanging around his neck.<br> <br>Mueller confronted Walker by the fire escape window. Two men standing inches apart in the darkened apartment. Mueller snapped, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he doing here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We said no press. No surprises. No embarrassments.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t hide his anger.<br> <br>&#x201c;I had no choice,&#x201d; Walker said laconically.<br> <br>Mueller gave the agent-in-charge a cold, hard glare and considered who in his chain of command had authorized a reporter. He held back what he wanted to say, that under the circumstances the best outcome for the CIA was that their man didn&#x2019;t take the bait, didn&#x2019;t show. &#x201c;We had an understanding,&#x201d; Mueller said. &#x201c;This wasn&#x2019;t it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a kid. He&#x2019;ll write what he&#x2019;s told to write.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does he think is happening?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Vice squad got a lead on a State Department guy who cruises Lincoln Park. Security risk. We arrest him and book him. Metro Police give the kid the story. He&#x2019;ll write what he&#x2019;s given.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mueller headed to the apartment door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A little fresh air.&#x201d;<br> <br>Walker raised his voice so that it carried to Mueller in the hall stairway. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>Outside, Mueller stood hidden from view on the top step of the building&#x2019;s stoop. He lit a cigarette. Habit. Then thought better of it and flicked it in the snow. His eyes settled on the empty street where he saw nothing to change his mind that the night was a bust. The Capitol Building fretted the tree line of the park, a gleaming dome in the night, a navigation point above the neighborhood&#x2019;s sprawling poverty. In the distance Mueller heard the anxious wail of a police siren and then behind him, the soft click of the door closing. He saw Walker. They stood side by side without talking.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hear you&#x2019;re leaving the Agency,&#x201d; Walker said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who told you that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One of the guys.&#x201d;<br> <br>Which guy? Mueller nodded. &#x201c;If we get him tonight I&#x2019;ll be gone by the end of the month.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s next?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fly-fishing.&#x201d; A lie.<br> <br>&#x201c;That will last a while.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mueller didn&#x2019;t indulge Walker&#x2019;s sarcasm. He didn&#x2019;t like Walker, but he tolerated him, and he kept him close to keep himself safe. Walker was too ambitious for Mueller&#x2019;s taste, quick to take credit for success, quick to blame others for his own mistakes. Mueller didn&#x2019;t like Walker&#x2019;s having that detail of his personal life. He kept private matters away from his job, but the daily grind made that hard. Each morning he got up to face the endless urgency of ambitious colleagues inventing useful crises. Politics had taken over everything. He was tired of the double life, the daily mask, and he&#x2019;d lost his ability to appear interested in a conversation when he was bored out of his mind. Walker bored him. But he knew Walker well enough not to trust him. Walker was a good weatherman of Washington&#x2019;s changing political winds and he was a good spy hunter.<br> <br>Mueller&#x2019;s exhale came at last. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get the tip?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The mailbox on East Capitol we&#x2019;ve been watching. Someone left a chalk mark. This is the dead drop.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, or you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She left the lobby without the package. What else would it be?&#x201d; Then, confidently, &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll come.&#x201d;<br> <br>The two men stood in the dark. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get it,&#x201d; Walker said. &#x201c;Great reputation, but your results stink. Vienna was a failure. So was Hungary. Last week you lost Leisz.&#x201d; Walker paused. His breath fogged in the chilly night air. &#x201c;Word is you guys got the news Stalin died by listening to Radio Moscow.&#x201d; Walker flicked his butt to the snow. &#x201c;Great reputation, but your results stink.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Piss off,&#x201d; Mueller said. He thought about the damn fool Leisz. Ignored the rules after he&#x2019;d been warned, thinking he wasn&#x2019;t at risk, then got sloppy and paid for it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d; A voice from the window above.<br> <br>Mueller and Walker saw the young black woman at the same time. Blond wig, leopard-skin coat, stiletto heels, and a tiny rhinestone purse clutched in one hand. She had emerged from the tree line at Lincoln Park and glanced both ways before making a two-step hustle across the street. Mueller and Walker stepped back deeper into shadow.<br> <br>When she achieved the opposite sidewalk she glanced over her shoulder. Mueller followed her line of sight to the streetlamp cleaving the darkness at the park&#x2019;s edge. From the trees stepped an army enlisted man. Mueller saw the drab sameness of style of someone who sought to fit in, go unnoticed. Long khaki coat, a visor cap pulled down on his forehead, and a steady stride that didn&#x2019;t bring attention to itself. She baited him with exaggerated hip movements and a calculated head nod. The start of another war had kept Washington filled with single men, and with single men came dreary bars with women who sold themselves.<br> <br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t come with this sideshow,&#x201d; Mueller said.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll leave. Hail a taxi. Go to a hotel.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mueller lit another cigarette and then regretted his choice again. He ground it under his heel. Drinking and smoking, two occupational hazards that had begun to wear on him.<br> <br>The woman walked up the block, but slowed her stride to allow the man to catch up. The air was cold and crisp, sharp like flint. Suddenly she stopped. The two talked on the sidewalk. A bargain was struck.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something odd about him,&#x201d; Mueller said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Odd?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The uniform. His shoes. He&#x2019;s wearing loafers.&#x201d;<br> <br>The enlisted man opened the iron gate for the woman and then followed her up the steps to the apartment house lobby. He shot a glance over his shoulder before disappearing inside.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you saying?&#x201d; Walker asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s him?&#x201d; Then a demand. &#x201c;You think it&#x2019;s him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not my call.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mueller saw Walker&#x2019;s discomfort and he felt the torment of the decision he faced. Both men knew it would be impossible to recover from a bad call.<br> <br>&#x201c;So be it,&#x201d; Walker muttered. He pulled on his glove, stretching his fingers deep into the leather, and clenched a fist.<br> <br>Mueller watched the FBI assemble. Walker signaled his agent in the phone booth, who in turn placed a call. It took a minute, or less, for the Buick and two unmarked cars to converge on the apartment building. Two agents, handguns drawn, stepped from the first car and hustled up the steps to the lobby. Four other men took up positions at their cars, and one crouched agent scrambled toward the rear of the building.<br> <br>Walker stood in the street barking orders to his team, and the sudden noise brought neighborhood residents to their windows. They saw black cars stopped at oblique angles on the street, doors flung open.<br> <br>Mueller stayed out of sight, alone. He saw an FBI agent escort the army enlisted man down the stoop tightly gripping his arm. The enlisted man had lost his hat, his wrists were handcuffed behind his back, and his unbuckled pants rode down his hips. He looked dazed and embarassed.<br> <br>A second agent had cuffed the prostitute and guided her, protesting, toward a car. Her wig was gone and she was hobbling on one broken heel, shouting fierce baritone obscenities at the agent who hustled her down the steps.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t rush me,&#x201d; the transvestite yelled, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll sprain an ankle.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mueller waited until Walker emerged from the apartment lobby and then he stepped out from his hiding spot. They met halfway across the street, Walker agitated, his face twisted in a scowl. He waved a stack of bills at Mueller as he walked past. &#x201c;Keep this farce to yourself,&#x201d; he snapped. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say a thing. Not a word. Hear me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Walker slipped in the Buick&#x2019;s front seat and slammed his door shut. In a minute the cars were all gone and Mueller stood alone. There was one orphaned stiletto heel on the sidewalk that he dropped in a garbage can.<br> <br>He walked rapidly away. He didn&#x2019;t bother to look behind to see if anyone noticed him, or to check on the curious neighbors. But at the end of the street he happened to turn. An instinct he&#x2019;d acquired in Vienna after the war, the feeling of knowing when he was being observed. There at the corner in the shadow of a mature tree, a tall man in a gray homburg, hands shoved in the pockets of a long trench coat. There was something suspicious about the figure. Mueller read into every stranger the possibility the person was tailing him, and this man got his attention. Mueller stood there thirty feet away on the other side of the street, staring at the motionless figure, who stared back. Mueller couldn&#x2019;t make out the man&#x2019;s face, or the shape of his jawline in the hat&#x2019;s deep shadow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, you,&#x201d; Mueller yelled.<br> <br>He went to cross the street, but a garbage truck fitted with a snowplow lumbered by in a riot of noise. When the truck passed, Mueller looked for the man, but he was gone.</p><h2>Inuyasha (VIZBIG Edition), Vol. 18: Curtain of Time (18)</h2><p>Kagome is an ordinary modern high school girl living an ordinary life.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008.

Why would he want to give up something that makes him feel so good, so relaxed, so tuned-out? As Benjie sees it, there&#39;s nothing much to tune in for. School is a waste of time, and home life isn&#39;t much better. All Benjie wants is for someone to believe in him, for someone to believe that he&#39;s more than a thirteen-year-old junkie. Told from the perspectives of the people in his life-including his mother, stepfather, teachers, drug dealer, and best friend-this powerful story will draw you into Benjie&#39;s troubled world and force you to confront the uncertainty of his future.</p><p>Dope. Smack. Junk. Heroin. No matter what you call it, you can&#39;t change the fact that 13-year-old Benjie is on it. Oh no ... he&#39;s not hooked, though. He could stop anytime ... really. But why is a young kid like Benjie using at all? Originally published in 1973, Alice Childress&#39;s novel remains one of the most profound explorations of an addict&#39;s world ever written. What makes this novel different is that Childress points no fingers and offers no easy answers. Her characters&#39; moods and motivations are complex, fresh, unexpected, and courageously real. Woven into Benjie&#39;s own ramblings about his situation are the thoughts of those involved by association--his mother, stepfather, friends, the pusher, and teachers at his school. This narrative technique creates a rich, heroic portrait of the social and psychological circumstances of addiction, love, and family.Benjie can stop using heroin anytime he wants to.

Meanwhile, across town, a team of civil rights lawyers fight an intrepid battle to end the de facto segregation that beleaguers Jeremy&#39;s school and hundreds of others across America. From inside the classroom and the courtroom, Eaton reveals the unsettling truths about an education system that leaves millions of children behind and gives voice to those who strive against overwhelming odds for a better future.</p><p>In a country long divided by race and class, Susan Eaton set out to see if separate can ever really be equal.

Svenson, a prolific yet somewhat anonymous, writer of books for children. Jerry West was the pen name assigned to Svenson when he started writing The Happy Hollisters for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book packager well-known for its development of children's book series including Tom Swift, The Bobbsey Twins, The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew. Many of these series were intended to have long publishing lives, and were written by multiple authors using the same pseudonym. The Happy Hollisters, however, were all written by Andrew Svenson, whose identity as Jerry West was kept secret until several years after his death in 1975. Andrew Svenson was born in Belleville, NJ, in 1910, and his interest in writing started early. He was editor of his high school newspaper and yearbook at Barringer High School in Newark, and then went on to study Creative Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. After his graduation in 1932, he worked as a reporter and editor for the Newark Star Eagle and the Newark Evening News. During this time, Andrew Svenson was encouraged by his friend and co-worker Howard Garis (author of Uncle Wiggily) to try his hand at juvenile fiction. Svenson joined the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1948, where he contributed to established series as Franklin W. Dixon (The Hardy Boys) and as Laura Lee Hope (The Bobbsey Twins). The first volume in The Happy Hollisters was published in 1953 by Doubleday &amp; Company, and he was made a partner in the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1961. As he wrote and developed 33 titles in The Happy Hollisters, he was also creating additional series for children under other pen names: Bret King by Dan Scott and The Tollivers by Alan Stone, the first series written for and about African-American children. Andrew Svenson wrote more than 70 adventure and mystery novels for children, which were published in 17 languages and sold millions of copies. The Hollister family was modeled on his own family and he often used Svenson family events and travels as the foundation for The Happy Hollisters books. He also kept copious newspaper clippings for story ideas, and interviewed hundreds of school children and teachers for additional suggestions. These ideas were then worked into his storylines, adding an educational element that was appreciated by parents and educators alike. Children loved the books for their elements of danger and excitement geared to their comprehension level.</p><h2>Mother Food: A Breastfeeding Diet Guide with Lactogenic Foods and Herbs - Build Milk Supply, Boost Immunity, Lift Depression, Detox, Lose Weight, Optimize a Baby&#39;s IQ, and Reduce Colic and Allergies</h2><p>Beyond easy-fast recipes and remedies that promote milk production and a mother&#39;s best health, MOTHER FOOD guides mothers through the weeks after childbirth with emotional support and wisdom. Colic, fussiness, allergies - each of these areas can be improved with awareness around the mother&#39;s food choices. Fatigue, depression, feelings of failure, auto-immune disease, food cravings and weight issues - each of these can be improved with better food choices. A mother&#39;s and her baby&#39;s future health can be taken to the next level by solving the postpartum problems now: this is the wisdom and mission of Hilary Jacobson&#39;s writing. MOTHER FOOD is endorsed by La Leche League, midwives, doulas, CLCs and IBCLCs (board certified lactation consultants), many of whom apply the practices described in MOTHER FOOD in their practice with mothers. Inspired by MOTHER FOOD, lists of lactogenic foods and herbs are now given to mothers as handouts in clinics and hospitals. Recipe books are now available, and other books describing the lactogenic diet. But these lists and books do not address and encompass the entire scope of possibilities that are described in easy-to-read language in MOTHER FOOD. This book is written to give parents a path to better health, better intelligence and focus, and a happier and healthier family.</p><p>Expert Reviews: <p>Linda Folden Palmer, DC, author of "Baby Matters" and "The Baby Bond": </p><p>Jacobson covers a wide array of pertinent topics in this book, with an excellent understanding of the current spectrum of maternal, lactation professional, and science knowledge (each of which seem to have gaps between them), and adds lots of insightful and fun historic and anthropologic information along the way. </p><p> She's raised my own consciousness in my own favorite directions: just how intimately and distinctly our food choices affect us. </p><p>Something to bring to the beach for pleasure reading if you have ANY interest in infant feeding; really. A must-read for lactation professionals, and for breastfeeding mothers with any challenges at all. My dream to see pediatricians read. </p><p>Diana West, BA, IBCLC, author of "Defining your Own Success: Breastfeeding After Breast Reduction Surgery" and "Making More Milk": </p><p>"A book about the way foods influence milk composition - truly excellent." </p><p>Lisa Marasco, MA, IBCLC, author of "Making More Milk": </p><p>"What we eat CAN matter. `Mother Food' is a wonderful collection of historical traditions from cultures around the world and what they feed mothers to support good health, breastfeeding, and plentiful milk production. Hilary Jacobson has put years of research into pulling together information that has almost been lost to the western world; every mother will benefit from reading this book, as well as anyone who works with or supports breastfeeding mothers." </p><p>Cheryl R. Scott, RN, IBCLC, Ph.D.: </p><p>"This book is a `must read' book for all pregnant and breastfeeding mothers along with their health care providers. Mrs. Jacobson provides information on how to avoid allergies, how to lower a mother's toxic load, how to prevent over-detoxification while breastfeeding, how to prevent infant colic, postpartum depression, anemia, insulin resistance, food cravings and food addictions along with how to promote and create a healthy milk supply. I love all of the helpful and yummy recipes sprinkled throughout the book." </p><p>Sheila Humphrey, RSC, RN, IBCLC, author of "Nursing Mothers Herbal": </p><p>"I like `Mother Food's' independent originality. Reading `Mother Food' is like entering a garden with intriguing viewpoints and a number of paths that invite further exploration. One's imagination is given permission to run rampant within beautifully arranged beds of knowledge that reveal themselves slowly along the meandering but manicured paths. For many restricted to thinking only with evidence-based information, reading the book will be like finding an inviting gate leading out of a walled city." &nbsp;</p>Hilary Jacobson was faced by a conundrum: serious low milk supply with each of her four children. A student of nutrition and herbalism since her teens, she now learned about herbs and foods used traditionally in Europe, Asia, by Native Americans and in Africa to increase milk supply, the so-called 'galactagogues.' These enabled her to maintain an abundant milk supply. <p>Jacobson: "This knowledge felt like a birthright. I thought all mothers should know it is possible to gain a degree of control over your body's ability to produce milk and your baby's ability to digest it. It is impossible to imagine how crucial these two things are unless you are a mother dealing with these issues." </p><p>When Jacobson learned that mothers in many cultures do in fact pass down this knowledge through the generations, and that it has been lost only in western culture, she resolved to write a book that would return this knowledge to western women. </p><p>Hilary Jacobson was born in California. She is a music teacher and writer, and lived thirty years in Switzerland where she raised her four children. She now lives in Southern California where she is writing the Mother Food Books Series.</p></p><h2>Managing and Using Information Systems: A Strategic Approach</h2><p><p><i>Managing &amp; Using Information Systems: A Strategic Approach </i>provides a solid knowledgebase of basic concepts to help readers become informed, competent participants in Information Systems (IS) decisions.

This book was written in the same spirit that claims - &#x201c;We are not a glum lot.&#x201d; This book has been received with such favor that I have now written a second book to add to it, another 101 cliches, so people now have more cliches and commentary to ponder and enjoy. In the Big Book, an alcoholic&#x2019; states, &#x201c;...the most compelling part of A.A., the part that made me want to try this sober thing, was the laughter, the pure joy of the laughter that I heard only from sober alcoholics.&#x201d; This book was written first, with the hope to spread this laughter to the newcomer that has lost all hope. Secondly, it serves to enlighten and dispel rumors about AA, to inform people who are simply curious about the teachings of A.A. It tells what it is really like from someone who has taken the journey and recovered. It is filled with witty heartfelt clich�s that are so true, so sharp, they make the old-timers smile and the newcomers cringe. The clich�s are used to teach newcomers the greater truths about the cure for alcoholism. Each clich� is a parable, an allegorical truth that is then explained using plainly stated information from knowledgable sponsors and the Big Book with humorous commentary from a recovered alcoholic. This book is not fluff, nor is it for the faint hearted. The world of alcohol and drug abuse is not pretty, nor one easily explained or understood. This book is gritty, informative, and at the same time inspirational and full of joy and hope, but most of all it was written with the newcomer in mind, so it does a balancing act just for them. It is meant to be simple, when I was first getting sober I had the attention span of a gnat. It is honest and funny and gives a glimpse of just how ugly addiction gets and how attractive real recovery can be. After reading about us, our cliches and our solution to a condition described as cunning, baffling and powerful, it is my hope at least some will say, "Yes, I am one of them, too; I, too, must have this thing."

He was put into the psych cell of the county jail with 3 other deranged prisoners when he answered the question, "Are you suicidal?" with "Can I see the charges first?" He was then told he could potentially be serving up to 10 years in Ionia State Prison. Family, friends and lawyer urged Bob to submit to an intense in-house alcohol and drug treatment facility called Dawn Farm in lieu of the upcoming trial. It was a no-nonsense recovery center founded on the accumulated wisdom of AA and the founding principles of Bill W and the Oxford Group. This was the beginning of Bob's strange journey back to sanity.

Businesses like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple use Scrum to drive incredibly fast innovation, laser focus on customers, and continuous improvement, and to decrease decision times in order to reshape the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Scrum is the most utilized Agile framework. In recent years, its use has exploded across the corporate world, far beyond its software and technology roots.<br> &nbsp;<br> J. J. Sutherland and the team at Scrum Inc. have dramatically improved performance at global banks, utility providers, medical device manufacturers, mining giants, and firms on the cutting edge of genetic science. Scrum has helped companies large and small thrive in the age of disruption.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Sutherland&#x2019;s first book, the national bestseller <i>Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time</i>, coauthored with his father, Jeff, the co-creator of Scrum, he laid out the Scrum framework used by almost all of today&#x2019;s leading technology companies.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Scrum Fieldbook,</i> he draws on his firm&#x2019;s extensive experience in the field to take leaders, managers, and employees deeper into the specific challenges and new opportunities organizations face in an Agile transformation. He shows how the Scrum framework can be successfully applied to any project in any industry, from automobile manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe to nonprofits in Africa, from home renovation contractors in Minnesota to gas exploration companies in South America, from fighter plane builders in Sweden to U.S. Navy Special Forces teams in regions of the world we can&#x2019;t mention.</p><p><b>J. J. Sutherland</b> is the CEO of Scrum Inc., a consulting and training firm that uses Scrum to rapidly deliver results in companies around the globe. He is the coauthor of <i>Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time,</i> written with his father, Jeff Sutherland, the co-creator of Scrum. Previously, he was an award-winning correspondent, producer, and Baghdad bureau chief for NPR. He covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Arab Spring, and the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami in Japan. He has won duPont, Peabody, Edward R. Murrow, and Lowell Thomas awards for his work.<b> </b>He lives in Washington, D.C., with his family.<b>Chapter 4</b><br><b> Busy vs. Done</b><br><br> Confirmation.com is a company created to solve a problem that wasted thousands of hours and millions of trees each year. They took a manual process that was slow and painful and hard and made it electronic, fast, and easy.<br><br> What they do is confirm financial data through a huge global network of accounting firms, financial institutions, law firms, and corporations. They think it should be easy to find the truth. And they realize that financial fraud isn&#x2019;t going away, which is why the motto of their founder, Brian Fox, is that they help the good guys catch the bad guys.<br><br> Let me give you just one illustrative example. The founder and chairman of Peregrine Financial Group, Russell Wassendorf Sr., defrauded investors out of more than $200 million over a period of years. How did he do it? A little Photoshop and he was able to create real-�looking bank statements. The whole thing came tumbling down when Peregrine was forced to begin using Confirmation.�com. Within days the fraud became clear. And Wassendorf still has decades left in jail for his crimes.<br><br> For more than a hundred years, the confirmation process was done on paper. An auditor would send confirmation requests by mail to a bank: <i>Does the institution being audited actually have this much money? </i>The bank would receive not only this request but thousands of others&#x2014;�even hundreds of thousands&#x2014;�each year. Banks had to have whole groups of people deal with it. Each confirmation request needed to be responded to by manually checking the bank records, writing a letter that confirmed the institution had that much money, and sending it back by mail. Paper. Lots and lots of paper. It took <i>weeks</i> for each and every one of the many, many tens of thousands of these requests made each year.<br><br> Confirmation.com made all this happen in a matter of moments. When someone makes a request, Confirmation.com directs that request to one of the thousands of connected banks in its network, gets the response, and passes it back to the auditor. The amount of security needed to move all that sensitive financial data around is critical. And that was the hard part in the beginning: getting financial institutions, accounting firms, law firms, and their mutual clients to trust the Confirmation.com system.<br><br> Confirmation.com pioneered the idea of electronic confirmations almost twenty years ago&#x2014;�receiving seven patents along the way&#x2014;�and is still dominant in the space by a large margin. It started with one bank and one accounting firm in Nashville, Tennessee, and now sixteen thousand accounting firms, four thousand banks, and five thousand law firms in 160 countries use their platform. They confirm more than a trillion dollars of assets each year.<br><br> When the company started back in 2000, at first it was just four people, literally in a garage, cranking out their product, this new thing that had never been done before, which Brian envisioned and wrote up as his entrepreneurship paper in business school. Eventually big banks started to realize the amount of work they would save and the speed they would gain, and ultimately said they would only accept requests through Confirmation.com&#x2019;s platform&#x2014;�no more paper. Confirmation.com grew rapidly, and they started to add new features and new confirmation types&#x2014;�like legal confirmations&#x2014;�to their platform.<br><br> But then something happened. They weren&#x2019;t getting things done quickly enough. They were missing deadlines. The code quality a platform like theirs requires wasn&#x2019;t there. They certainly weren&#x2019;t going to risk that, so they took more time to try to get it right. Oh, they had people working hard. They were busy. One executive there told us he had to keep everyone busy. Hopefully they&#x2019;d get something done, but if they didn&#x2019;t, he could at least say he tried. But they were simply unable to get stuff out the door. Everyone was busy, but not much was getting done. So they called us.<br><br> This is a fairly typical issue in corporations. Some project&#x2014;�it doesn&#x2019;t matter what it is&#x2014;�must get done. Management or sales or somebody has said it&#x2019;s a top priority. Then someone else says something else is also a top priority. And someone else brings in yet another. And, of course, none of these people insisting that their priority is what everyone should focus on talk to one another. They just keep shoving them down on the teams. This is horrifyingly commonplace. Then, with the predictability of gravity, things stop getting done. So management starts putting pressure on the team. They want them to be busy all the time working on the many, many things that are all top priority. They make them work nights and weekends to meet an arbitrary deadline that they promised to someone. And they are mystified when it doesn&#x2019;t happen.<br><br><b>Facts Can Be Stubborn Things</b><br> <i>Priority</i> is an old word. It began its life in the late fourteenth century when the French borrowed a Latin word to indicate the state of being earlier&#x2014;�this event happened before that event. It entered English in the early fifteenth century, referring to precedence in right or rank. (Incidentally, it&#x2019;s a singular word. Saying something is a &#x201c;top priority&#x201d; is redundant. It&#x2019;s using two words to say one thing. Another linguistic tidbit: Latin words aren&#x2019;t pluralized by putting an s on the end, so the word <i>priorities</i> is actually nonsensical. It quite literally does not make any sense. It&#x2019;s like saying there were five first-�place finishers in a race.)<br><br> If you run a Google Ngram search (that&#x2019;s where Google looks at however many thousands of books over the past few hundred years and counts how often words are used) on <i>priorities</i>, you get a graph that shows a significant increase in the 1940s and then continuous annual increases beginning in the 1960s.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Priorities</i> wasn&#x2019;t even a word until about 1940. I&#x2019;m not dead certain about causation, but there is a certain correlation between the rise of the modern management movement of postwar in�dustry and the birth of a new word that sounds seemingly logical and rigorous while actually being meaningless. That seems telling to me.<br><br><b> Stop Starting, Start Finishing</b><br> When Scrum Inc. goes into a company to assess how Agile they are, we usually find that about 30 percent of the work being done should not be done at all. That work is actually in <i>opposition</i> to goals of the business. Stop that. The Standish Group data says, and this is what we find, that 64 percent of the remaining 70&nbsp;percent are working on features that the customer rarely or never uses. That means 75 percent of people in a company are <br> either actively working against the business interests or are working on things that no one wants. Let that sink in for a second. Three-�quarters of your company shouldn&#x2019;t be doing what they are doing.<br><br> The reason for this is that people refuse, or don&#x2019;t know how, to prioritize. (Another quick linguistic factoid: Apparently prioritize wasn&#x2019;t a word until it was first made up by government bureaucrats in the 1950s and popularized in the presidential campaign of 1972 when political operatives had to choose which voting districts to target. As the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> put it in 1982, it is &#x201c;a word that at present sits uneasily in the language.&#x201d; It apparently sits uneasily in people&#x2019;s practices as well.)<br><br> Here are the symptoms we see. If you hear or utter any of these phrases, you might want to rethink your approach:<br><br> <i>&#x201c;We have multiple conflicting priorities.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i> &#x201c;Our teams are constantly disrupted by new priorities.&#x201d;</i><br><br><i> &#x201c;Everything is the number one priority.&#x201d;</i><br><br> The thing that kills me is that everyone knows these are bad things. Not a single person I have ever spoken to thinks that working on five things at once and disrupting even that work for new urgent things is a good idea. No one. We all know it&#x2019;s stupid. But we all do it anyway.<br><br> At Confirmation.com, everyone had different priorities. Sales wanted a better Japanese translation so they could sell there, marketing wanted to rebrand the website, and the leadership was concerned with an upstart competitor. So what should the product teams focus on? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m always waiting to hear what the new rules are today,&#x201d; one executive told Avi Schneier, Scrum Inc.&#x2019;s principal on the case. When Avi asked what the company&#x2019;s number one priority was, he was told, &#x201c;Meeting deadlines.&#x201d; Not what needed to be done, notice, just the deadline itself.<br><br> So Avi had them work through the company&#x2019;s real priorities. What are they? What is the most important thing? He helped them see that without choosing those priorities, they ended up with a company adrift, going in a different direction each day. So they made those choices. It can be done, but it requires honest reflection and some tough decisions.</p><h2>Pendulum Healing Commands Guide: Part 1</h2><p>Pendulum Healing is the use of a pendulum to stimulate change and make what you want to have happen more likely to occur.

Mrs. Martin takes us behind the curtain to see in rich detail what alternative education really looks like when it bestows upon its subjects the freedom to choose. Every parent who feels compelled to give their kids into the care of total strangers should read this book. --John Taylor Gatto, Author: Dumbing Us Down And Weapons of Mass InstructionProduct DescriptionRadical Unschooling is a progressive parenting philosophy, which includes children learning at home. It is different from homeschooling in that children are not forced to follow curriculum lessons and tests. Radical Unschooling philosophy focuses on trust of a child&#39;s innate ability to learn without coercion and invites children to explore their passions. The parent&#39;s role is to facilitate their interests and curiosity.Radical Unschooling - the book - focuses also on the evolutionary aspect of parenting and human consciousness. We are parenting and educating our children today to succeed in a joyful, productive life by following their passions, not someone else&#39;s agenda.The main presentations are - School is only one of many choices for our children in our technologically advanced world. - Forced learning isn&#39;t effective and causes more damage than formerly thought. - Respecting a child&#39;s choice and autonomy is an evolution of understanding and birth right of every human. - Learning and life are not separate. Learning is pleasurable if it is not forced on us. - Separating life into subjects isn&#39;t necessary or natural. - Humans learn from all that they do and experience in life, not just what our culture deems &#39;&#39;educational.&#39;&#39; - The main focus of parenting today is obedience and meeting the needs of the parent. This has to change if we want our children to live in a peaceful world.Moreover, Radical Unschooling is just radical enough to herald a wake up call to our culture because of the truth the philosophy speaks.</p><p></p><h2>That Kind of Mother: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>NAMED A&nbsp;RECOMMENDED BOOK OF 2018 BY:<br></strong><strong><em>Buzzfeed&nbsp;� The Boston Globe �&nbsp; The Millions � InStyle �&nbsp;Southern Living �&nbsp;Vogue � Popsugar � Kirkus � The Washington Post � Library Journal � Real Simple </em></strong><strong><em>� NPR</em></strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;With his unerring eye for nuance and unsparing sense of irony, Rumaan Alam&#x2019;s second novel is both heartfelt and thought-provoking.&#x201d;<br></strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;Celeste Ng, author of&nbsp;<em>Little Fires Everywhere</em></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>From the celebrated author of&nbsp;<em>Rich and Pretty</em>, a novel about the families we fight to build and those we fight to keep</strong></p><p>Like many first-time mothers, Rebecca Stone finds herself both deeply in love with her newborn son and deeply overwhelmed.&nbsp;Struggling to juggle&nbsp;the demands of motherhood with her own aspirations and feeling utterly alone in the process, she reaches out to the only person at the hospital who offers her any real help&#x2014;Priscilla Johnson&#x2014;and begs her to come home with them as her son&#x2019;s nanny.</p><p><br>Priscilla&#x2019;s presence quickly does as much to shake up Rebecca&#x2019;s perception of the world as it does to stabilize her life.

This book breaks down blacksmithing&#x2019;s fascinating, if somewhat daunting, skill set into attainable fundamentals that show you how to become an accomplished smith. My goal is not to teach you how to make a hook or a knife. Rather, I focus on the core aim of becoming a successful blacksmith or weekend hobbyist. What results is a collection of paramount blacksmithing practices and lessons, distilling what I and others have learned over many years. In this book, I aim both to motivate you, and to educate you concerning the nuances of starting a shop and becoming a blacksmith (without breaking the bank). You will learn how much space is needed for a shop, and what you can expect that amount of space to do for you in terms of quantity and quality of output. You will also learn which tools are essential, and which are a luxury, as well as how much these tools cost, where to acquire them, and how long it will take to acquire them. Safety and ergonomic practices are a must in the shop, and a section in this book reflects this with appropriate &#x201c;real world&#x201d; safety education. But what about the most important question? How to teach yourself? Have you even thought about it? This IS the book for anyone starting blacksmithing, or even for someone already at an intermediate skill level. The book answers the most simple yet complex and thought inducing questions confronted by anyone getting started in blacksmithing.</p><p>In the summer of 2008 I was 13 years old, anxiously waiting to become an eighth grader and bored out of my mind one evening in the mountains of Appalachia. Without permission from my dad (I quickly learned that acting first and asking for forgiveness later has it&#x2019;s benefits) I found a piece of aluminum suitable for smashing. A small stick fire was built and the aluminum started taking shape with the help of an old framing hammer. I soon discovered the wonder in flattening and shaping metal that would forever change the direction of my future. A few hours later, this time with the help of my father, we dug out a massive pit in the ground to build a larger wood fire in which I used to heat up my first piece of glowing red steel. I learned quickly how to use tongs.... I had already caught the bug, so we gathered and scrounged for the essential tools from around the house to start forging immediately. When I get a new idea or itch to do something, I have a tendency to do it right away, even if it means I don&#x2019;t have the optimum set up. These keystone tools that went to build my future career would be the anvil, tongs, and hammer. The anvil used was an old ball hitch, hardly your best case scenario, but this weighed around 10 pounds and had a solid enough surface to hammer steel on. The tongs were vise grips reluctantly surrendered from my father&#x2019;s tool box, and the hammer was an old claw framing hammer. Doesn&#x2019;t sound too luxurious does it? Well I thought it was! All of this was expeditiously gathered and underway in one evening, without leaving the house. In the same day I went from becoming a bored 13 year-old to a fascinated up and coming blacksmith. All of this evolved into the current business and passion I have today. At the age of 19 I was fortunate enough to purchase a beautiful 10 acre plot of land outside of Boone, NC for the future site of Hoffman Blacksmithing to be constructed in spring of 2018. I&#x2019;ve been able to teach private lessons to students from as far away as Australia, and create a career I wouldn&#x2019;t have dreamed of when I started. Today, in the year 2017, I specialize in hand forged axes with the help of my team. Currently I&#x2019;m 21 years old and excited to have bigger and better plans for the years to come, growing and transforming my craft and business.</p><h2>Lychee Light Club</h2><p>The <i>Lychee Light Club </i>is considered Usamaru Furuya's breakthrough work. Originally designed as an experiemental project Lychee's themes of youthful rebellion and deus ex machina destruction, and attractive designs eventually won over a new generation of readers and critics, leading the way for Furuya to take on his many recent high profile properties.<br><br>In an abandoned warehouse, a band of nine students have assembled to plot out a new future.&nbsp; Their "leader" Zera is determined to cleanse his community of the ugly and cowardly. Having taken command of a band of young men to build him a god-like machine capable of changing the world.&nbsp; This machine, named "Lychee," will give them what they've been searching for...a beauty of the finest quality. <br><br>A surreal yet touching horror comedy Furuya's Lychee Light Club that mixes elements of French Le Th��tre du Grand-Guignol and with modern day pop culture tropes and is set in modern day Tokyo. Shocking, sexy and innovative, the <i>Lychee Light Club</i> is at the pinnacle of modern day Japanese <i>seinen</i> manga (young adult comics).</p><p>Usamaru Furuya was born in Tokyo, Japan on January 25th, 1968. A graduate of the Tama Arts University, with a focus on oil painting, Furuya is currently considered one of the most talented artists in the industry today. A former student in the Osamu Tezuka Manga Correspondance Program, Furuya's drawings as a teen were often published in the pages of the seminal boys comics magazine <i>Shounen King</i>. <br><br>Upon entering high school, Furuya began to embrace his darkside experimenting with subculture and the undergroud art scene. An early participant in the Tokyo version of the Le Th��tre du Grand-Guignol, he started off with them creating&nbsp;puppets and set designs for their elaborate performances. After graduating from university, Usamaru turned his attention to the world of comics. His early projects combined the surreal with extremely modern political commentary winning him critical acclaim worldwide for his juxtapositions of Tokyo youth and their suit wearing salaryman counterparts. Since his debut in 1994, Furuya has gone to draw 16 titles for Japan's leading comics publishers Shogakukan and Shueisha (publishers of <i>Shonen Jump</i>).&#x201c;<i>Lychee Light Club</i> is unflinchingly graphic, and as such it requires a certain taste of its audience. Those who can stomach its depravity will be amply rewarded. Furuya&#x2019;s grimly elegant style [...] is a perverse kind of beauty, as visually bold and exploratory as its subject matter. One thing&#x2019;s for sure, you&#x2019;ll never look at lychee the same way again.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Otaku USA</i><br> <br>&#x201c;Furuya at his most deranged&#x2014;a masterpiece of gore and debauchery that will have your brain screaming in horror even as you read on in rapture. The plotline is simple enough&#x2014;the Light Club&#x2019;s descent into madness shows how absolute power corrupts absolutely&#x2014;but the complex themes and details make it unforgettable... It&#x2019;s shocking, disturbing, revolting&#x2014;and an instant pick for one of the year&#x2019;s best. Grade: A-&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Anime News Network</i><br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a gripping read&#x2014;quite literally&#x2014;as when it arrived I began absent-mindedly reading the first few pages and ended up sitting down in my kitchen and reading the whole book in one sitting... If you&#x2019;re looking for something violent, sexual, revolting and thought-provoking, then <i>Lychee Light Club</i> is a solid pick. It&#x2019;s definitely one of the better manga I&#x2019;ve read so far this year. Score: 9/10&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Japanator</i><br> <br>&#x201c;The manga is in a way a tragic love story and a horror novel at the same time that will leave the reader a bit shocked and enthralled... The translations all read well and their placement is great, avoiding getting in the way of the images... A great read. Grade: 4.5/5&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Examiner.com</i><br> <br>&#x201c;Gore so lovingly depicted that it almost transcends and becomes art... Make no mistake about it, this is a book filled with sadism, horrific violence and sexual situations, and depraved behavior. But it has a human heart in its Frankenstein-esque robot, and what I&#x2019;ll take from it is not the scenes of people being cut open and smashed into bits... More manga as thought-provoking as this, please.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>A Case Suitable for Treatment</i><br><br>"[Furuya's art] is refined and delicate with a dark edge...It's a creative, cerebral, and occasionally wry take on a genre that usually favors action over irony."--<i>About.com</i><br><br>"[Design] is undoubtedly Furuya&#x2019;s chief asset as an artist and he deploys this in spurts throughout the work at hand. Furuya&#x2019;s approach is akin to a type of popular surrealism which owes much to Dali and Magritte."--<i>Hooded Ultilitarian</i></p><h2>Let Me Grieve, But Not Forever</h2><p><p>On June 28, 1987, four Dallas-based Christian leaders were killed in an airplane crash as they were returning from a Focus on the Family retreat in Montana: George L.

This deeply moving book, gleaned from parts of journals that she kept during the loss of her husband, offers a source of hope and healing for anyone experiencing grief. With remarkable honesty, courage, and generosity, she shares how to examine grief and ultimately find healing in the process.<br></p></p><p>Verdell Davis is not only an accomplished author and speaker, but also a long-time educational consultant.

But, most of all,&nbsp;<em>The Whale</em>&nbsp;is a remarkably eloquent exploration of the way the need for honesty overwhelms us when we sense that our time is short." -Chris Jones,&nbsp;<em>Chicago Tribune</em><br><br>"A vibrant, provocative new play... The sharp-eared skill and sensitivity with which Hunter explores his thickly layered material are matched by his fair-mindedness." -Michael Feingold,&nbsp;<em>Village Voice</em><br><br>"Extraordinary... Hunter has constructed an outsize, gothic scenario in tender miniature, against a backdrop so blandly bleak we brace ourselves for despair: the sound of cascading highway traffic braids itself with the crashing surf inside Charlie's head. Is it all too much? Never for a second." -Scott Brown,&nbsp;<em>New York</em><br><br>"A deeply affecting and piercingly amusing play about guilt and connection... Hunter has given all of these funny-sad lost souls details that emerge bit b y bit and twist and expand the story in compelling ways." -Joe Dziemianowicz,&nbsp;<em>New York Daily News</em><br><br>"<em>The Whale</em>&nbsp;is a tragedy in a minor key, about a man torn between flesh and spirit... Humane, sharp and often funny." -David Cote,&nbsp;<em>TimeOut New York</em><br><br>"Samuel D. Hunter's compelling, psychologically complex play takes the audience to the confounding no man's land of nihilism." -John Lahr,&nbsp;<em>New Yorker</em></p><br><br><p><strong>Praise for&nbsp;<em>A Bright New Boise</em></strong><br><br>"A dark, droll and ultimately explosive work... Funny, compassionate and disturbing all at once, Hunter's quintessentially American scenario portrays an individual trapped in an emotional and cultural wasteland, his life configured by uncaring impersonal forces, his spirit hobbled by unnamed guilt." -Deborah Klugman,&nbsp;<em>LA Weekly</em><br><br>"A simple, superb little heartland heartbreaker... This is a rube tragedy--a respectful and honest-feeling one, for a change, with unquenchable humor and scrupulous emotional honesty--and by jingo, it sings." -Scott Brown,&nbsp;<em>New York</em><br><br>"Exhilarating...&nbsp;<em>A Bright New Boise</em>&nbsp;is an unsparing account of the hunger pangs in the barren American gut... Hunter has such highly sensitive antennae for the look and rhythm of mundane places that&nbsp;<em>A Bright New Boise</em>&nbsp;develops an authentic texture, separate from other pieces in its genre." -Peter Marks,&nbsp;<em>Washington Post</em><br><br>"Despite the crisp wind of despair that blows through Samuel D. Hunter's beautifully realized&nbsp;<em>A Bright New Boise</em>, this clear-eyed comedy about faith's meager harvest will still lift your heart. Some of it is simple delight in craft... The rest of our pleasures lie in Hunter's gentle characterizations, a plot that mingles absurdity and genuine philosophical investigation." -Helen Shaw,&nbsp;<em>TimeOut New York</em><br><br>"An anxious, funny look at the messianic and the mundane in America... Hunter delivers these characters and their crucibles with tenderness and rage. For all its mistrust of religion, the play is a kind of prayer." -Charles Isherwood,&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em></p></p><h2>Ten Poems for Difficult Times</h2><p>In his bestselling Ten Poems series, Roger Housden has shown an uncanny ability to choose and discuss poems that strike at the core of readers&#x2019; concerns and needs.

A native of England, he lives in Marin County, California, and teaches around the world.<strong>Introduction: Why Poetry for Difficult Times?</strong><br> Poetry is a concise and elemental means of expressing the deepest of human emotions: joy, sorrow, grief, hope, love and longing. This is why it connects us as a people and a community; it speaks for us and brings us together in a way few other forms of writing can do. I was in the process of moving to Manhattan in 2001, and in the weeks following 9/11 there were poems appearing on every available wall in the city. Even so, over the next ten years, while sitting alone in front of my computer finishing up another volume in my Ten Poems series, I would wonder at times whether I was wasting my time.<br> <br> After all, the world is in trouble. It has always been in trouble. Not only that, but we are often in trouble personally too. Surely there must be something more useful, more pressing, to give my time to than reflecting on poetry? Couldn&#x2019;t I go and start a project in Africa, or at least do some small thing to prevent climate catastrophe; start reducing my own carbon footprint, for example, and begin a movement to encourage others to do the same? But no; I wrote more poetry books, wondering all the while whether they and I were doing little more than making ourselves progressively irrelevant.<br> <br> I knew better, which is why I kept writing. I knew that great poetry has the power to start a fire in a person&#x2019;s life. It can alter the way we see ourselves. It can change the way we see the world. You may never have read a poem in your life, and yet you can pick up a volume, open it to any page, and suddenly find yourself blown into a world full of awe, dread, wonder, marvel, deep sorrow, and joy. Poetry not only matters; it is profoundly necessary. <em>Especially</em> in times of darkness and difficulty, both personal and collective. To read or to write poetry is a powerful, even subversive act; and it is one small thing we can do that can actually make a very big difference. <br> <br> It can make a difference because at its best poetry calls forth our deep Being; bids us live by its promptings. It dares us to break free from the safe strategies of the cautious mind; from our default attitudes and belief. It calls to us, like the wild geese, as Mary Oliver would say, from an open sky. It is a magical art, and always has been &#x2014; a making of language spells designed to open our eyes, open our doors and welcome us into a bigger world, one of possibilities we may never have dared to dream of. This is also why poetry can be dangerous: because we may never be the same again after reading a poem that happens to speak to our own life directly. I know that when I meet my own life in a great poem, I feel opened, clarified, confirmed somehow in what I always sensed was true but had no words for. Anything that can do this is surely necessary for the fullness of a human life.<br> <br> At its heart, poetry is a moral act. It aims to restore the uprightness of the self &#x2014; first, the poet&#x2019;s self, and then by extension, the reader&#x2019;s. When in later life W.B. Yeats revised some of his early poems, his friends were aghast. In response he wrote:<br> <br> <em>The friends that have it I do wrong<br> Whenever I remake a song,<br> Should know what issue is at stake:<br> It is I myself that I remake.<br> <br> </em>(Introduction to <em>Complete Poem</em>s 1908.)<br> <br> The word &#x201c;poet&#x201d; means a maker &#x2014; someone who crafts language into a shape. The word maker has the same etymological root as the words matrix, and magic, and it&#x2019;s true that the sound and the rhythm of good poetry is literally spellbinding. It lulls, it sways, it rises and falls, and our hearts and minds rise and fall along with it. Poetry literally entrains us into the energy, the mood, the vibration even, that the poet has conjured with her words and images. The more subtle and refined that energy is, the more it can raise us to the best that we are. That it can do this is another reason why poetry is so necessary today, when we need our best selves more than ever.<br> <br> Poetry revitalizes our imagination. A hundred years ago, when Yeats was alive, the imagination was far more of a common currency than it is today. The imagination today is under siege. Our political leaders, steeped in double speak and alternative facts, have brought George Orwell&#x2019;s <em>1984</em> closer than ever. We are saturated with both false and genuine information and find it a challenge to tell the difference. We are saturated with concepts and opinions that stream ready formed from Facebook or Twitter, which siphon our attention into an abstract, meta-world divorced from concrete reality. People engage less and less with the natural environment, less and less with each other in community, and rely more and more for their experience on the received knowledge that comes on a screen or down a wire.<br> <br> No wonder the imagination is in danger of shriveling to the size of a pea. Imagination feeds on the smell of old tree roots, on conversation, on barking dogs, the cries of children. Poetry&#x2019;s fuel is the imagination; it uses the things of this concrete world for its material, and then reaches down into the layers of meaning that any object or person contains. Pablo Neruda has written an ode to a lemon, to his socks, to laziness, to a tomato, to salt, and more. Poetry shows us that not just the gods, but the humblest forms in the world can reveal a truth and beauty to fill us with praise and awe. In his poem &#x201c;That Greeny Asphodel,&#x201d; William Carlos Williams reminds us that<br> <br> It is difficult<br> to get the news from poems<br> yet men die miserably every day<br> for lack<br> of what is found there.<br> <br> Poetry is a way of rescuing the world from oblivion by the practice of attention. It is our attention that honors and gives value to living things, that gives them their proper name and particularity, that retrieves them from the obscurity of the general. When I pay attention, something in me wakes up, and that something is much closer to who I am than the driven or drifting self I usually take myself to be. When I pay attention, I myself am straightened somehow, brought to a deeper life.<br> <br> Poetry makes a stand against the increasing homogenization of world cultures because it is the speech of one specific individual in their own unique voice. The sweeping homogenization and commodification of everything may be one reason why there are more poetry festivals, slams, groups, readings, creative writing courses than ever before. Poetry is the expression of one person&#x2019;s irreplaceable subjective sensibility, for which another name is soul. It is the creation of one person, one sensibility, giving form to how it feels to be oneself and to see the world through one&#x2019;s own eyes in the most precise language they can summon. <br> <br> Everyday language usually fails to do this well. But poetry reaches with its sounds and rhythms down below the realm of the conscious mind to awaken and nourish the imagination. Poetry is imagination&#x2019;s language, and as such, it is prophetic speech. In essence, what is found there is our deep humanity, which binds us in empathy for others, however different they may appear to be from us. In everyday language, we might say to someone, for example, &#x201c;I feel sick.&#x201d; Which doesn&#x2019;t tell the listener very much, and doesn&#x2019;t allow her to feel very much. But the poet Robert Lowell says I am sick this way:<br> <em><br> I hear my ill spirit sob in each blood cell<br> </em><br> This is how poetry says the unsayable. Lowell makes clear the nature of his sickness; it is a sickness of soul, one that pervades the entire body. And as the poet Mark Doty has observed in the essay &#x201c;Why Poetry Matters Now,&#x201d; Lowell&#x2019;s sickness sobs, and the sobbing is accentuated by the 11 vowels in that sentence, the alliteration on the b&#x2019;s and on the l&#x2019;s. All this makes the line thick and heavy in the mouth, Doty says, which is what sobbing does. Try saying it, and see what a mouthful it is. Lowell gives us the visceral experience, not just the information that he is sick, but what is sick and what it feels like.<br> <br> Lowell&#x2019;s line comes from the idiosyncratic stuff of his own selfhood &#x2014; from the unique soul of Lowell. Someone else would speak to sickness in a totally different way. Poetry is the individual soul given wings to land on a page. Here is Sylvia Plath with some lines on having a fever:<br> <br> <em>I am a lantern/my head a moon/ of Japanese paper. My gold beaten skin/infinitely delicate/and infinitely expensive. <br> <br> </em>The metaphors come tumbling over each other. She has stepped out of her body, it seems, and has made of it something other &#x2014; a lantern, which itself then becomes something other &#x2014; a moon. <br> <br> This is a long way from Lowell, but it&#x2019;s another world altogether from the blunt vagueness of &#x201c;I feel sick.&#x201d; The difference between the two poets is one of voice. And by the writer&#x2019;s voice we mean the way the particular texture of subjective perception finds its way into speech.<br> <br> Who knows how the image of a lantern came to Plath. She likely didn&#x2019;t know. Poems are a window onto soul because they honor the unknown, both in us and in the world. They come from the deep waters below our surface, they are shaped into form by the power of language, and set free to fly with wings of images and metaphor. Imagine a world in which everything is already known. It would be a dead world, no questions, no wonder, no other possibility. That&#x2019;s what my own world can feel like sometimes when my imagination has gone into retreat. I, like you no doubt, have discovered that poetry is a phoenix I can fly on to return to that forgotten land. <br> <br> Poetry&#x2019;s currency is language. It uses words that are known to all of us, but in a sequence and order that surprises us out of our normal speech rhythms and linear thought processes. Poetry is a unique combination of imaginative power and conscious intelligence, of inspiration and hard work, and its effect is to illuminate our lives and breathe new life, new seeing, new tasting into the world we thought we knew. Poetry bids us eat the apple whole.<br> <br> Poems like the ones in this book shake me awake. They pass on their attentiveness, their insight, their love of this broken world to me, the reader. We ourselves can wake up to the world and to ourselves in a new way by reading such poems as these. And especially when we read them aloud, and shape the sounds on our lips and the rhythms on our breath. This is why poetry can make us more fully human. The poet Jane Hirshfield has said it this way:<br> <br> <em>Whether from reading the New England Transcendentalists or Eskimo poetry, I feel that everything I know about being human has been deepened by the poems I&#x2019;ve read. <br> <br> </em>John Keats spoke of this humanizing power too, when he said that<em> Poetry should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost as a Remembrance.</em> <br> <br> That&#x2019;s all very well, you might say, poems may be a humanizing influence; they may even carry us to the heights of spiritual insight and realization; but what have they done to shift the world&#x2019;s obsession with power, greed, and violence? What has a poem done to dissolve injustice? This argument has been rising and falling for centuries, but it may be worth our notice that poetry and literature in general have been routinely banned around the world at different times because of their subversive influence. If poetry and literature are humanizing influences, they work directly against those regimes and ideologies that restrict rather than encourage liberty and justice. Nazim Hikmet, whose poem &#x201c;It&#x2019;s This Way&#x201d; is in this book, spent eighteen years in a Turkish prison for his beliefs. Because poetry connects different worlds, different ideas, and different people and things, it generates empathy &#x2014; empathy with others and with all living things. When, through a poetic act of imagination, one feels kinship with others and with all life, it is that much more difficult to oppress others; and that, in a tyrannical regime, is subversion. <br> <br> Stalin tried to strip Russia of its soul with his death camps. Mandelstam restored that soul by reciting poetry to his fellow convicts and by writing about it in his journal. &#x201c;Perhaps to remain a poet in such circumstances,&#x201d; Saul Bellow wrote, &#x201c;is also to reach the heart of politics. The human feelings, human experiences, the human form and face, recover their proper place &#x2014; the foreground.&#x201d;<br> <br> That, after all, is what politics is ultimately about &#x2014; human feelings and the human form and face. Poetry can give a human face to our collective struggles and remind us that this human world is not only broken, it is beautiful. That is what the poems in this volume do. There&#x2019;s a headstone in a Long Island graveyard &#x2014; the one where Jackson Pollock is buried &#x2014; that I think encapsulates the value and necessity of poetry in a world of sorrows. It says,<br> <br> <em>Artists and poets are the raw nerve ends of humanity. By themselves they can do little to save humanity. Without them there would be little worth saving.</em></p><h2>Little Shop of Hamsters (Goosebumps, Horror Land #14)</h2><p>Take a little Horror home with you!<br><br>Sam Waters is desperate to have a pet.

But that's a notion easier said than done when Anne's husband throws her out a couple of days later. The repercussions of the affair reverberate through the four carpool families--and Frances finds herself navigating a moral minefield that could make or break a marriage.</p><p><b>Abbi Waxman</b>, the author of<i> The Garden of Small Beginnings</i>, is a chocolate-loving, dog-loving woman who lives in Los Angeles and lies down as much as possible. She worked in advertising for many years, which is how she learned to write fiction. She has three daughters, three dogs, three cats, and one very patient husband.<b>One.</b><br><br> It was amazing how many children you could fit in a minivan, if you tessellated carefully and maintained only the most basic level of safety. Four in the very back, two of whom were painfully wedged in the space normally afforded to one child. A single lap belt over those two, a choice both illegal and stupid, but there you go-and thank goodness they were skinny. Frances Bloom always had this vague belief that, in the event of an accident, the pressure of all those little bodies would hold them in place. Ten seconds with a physicist would have cleared that up, but she didn't know any; and seeing as she rarely made it above twenty mph in traffic, she might have been right. She was a careful driver, especially with other people's kids in the car, and so far she hadn't needed to put her nutball theory to the test.<br><br> In the middle, the two littlest ones sat securely in actual car seats. And, next to her in the front, holding sway over the CD player with the attention to power and detail only a teenager could wield, her eldest daughter, Ava. Seven children, the genetic arsenal of four families. One big crash and the entire neighborhood would have had funeral scheduling issues. Not that it was a joking matter, of course. Frances just had these thoughts, what could you do? Rather than fight them and run the risk that they'd deepen her wrinkles, she just let the buggers run.<br><br> She'd been doing this carpool for too long, she thought. It probably wasn't a good sign that a car crash sounded like just one of several options, rather than something to be avoided. But honestly, how many times could you break up a fight over the CD player, or who had to sit in the middle, or whether they could watch a DVD, which they couldn't-and never could have, even before the in-car machine broke. When it was a full house, like this morning, it got so raucous that a tribe of howler monkeys would have fallen silent in awed appreciation. Mind you, these were professional children, the offspring of creative people and deep thinkers, who'd marveled over them as babies, encouraged them to express themselves as toddlers, and wished they'd been more consistent and mean to them now that they were old enough to sass back.<br><br> In the far backseat she had the two sibling children of her neighbors Anne and Charlie Porter: Kate and Theo. Lovely names, less than lovely children. Kate, six, specialized in the surprise attack, and often sat silently through the entire trip, rousing herself only to shove her brother viciously out of the van at the other end. Theo, nearly ten, never saw it coming. It wasn't that he was thick, per se, it was just that he never saw it coming. Theo himself preferred a full-frontal physical assault, with optional screaming in the ears. God knew how that dynamic would play out in therapy.<br><br> Interleaved between them, like two all-beef patties, were her son, Milo, who was ten, and his cousin Wyatt, who was six. They weren't really cousins, they were second cousins, or cousins once removed, or something. Wyatt's mother was Iris, who was actually Frances's cousin, but it was just easier to call the kids cousins and have done with it. Wyatt reveled in the riches of two mothers-his other one was an actress famous for being America's Honey. It wasn't a secret she was gay, it was just that America apparently didn't give a shit.<br><br> Right behind her-where she could reach back and hand them stuff at the traffic lights, which she often did-were her youngest child, Lally, and her neighbor Bill's son, Lucas, both of whom were four. It was a complicated carpool that had evolved over time. At first the various parents had tried to take turns driving, but as Frances had a kid at every school, it quickly became clear it was just easier if she did it. She preferred it; she was the only parent who wasn't "working" (let's not get into the atom splitting of who's doing more work, stay-at-home parents or not, let's just agree it's a shit show for all of us, and move on), so she wasn't trying to get anywhere herself, and often did the driving in pajamas. She also hated the feeling in the house just after the kids had screamed and yelled their way through getting ready-finding shoes and losing shoes, hunting down books and bags and hats and whatever, all of which they could have gotten ready the night before, not that she was making a point or anything-and had scrambled through the door and down the path to someone else's car . . . It made her feel like she'd been picked last for a team, or left behind at a train station, or like when she'd come home to an empty house after her own days at school. <i>I want to go, too</i>, her inner child cried, and her outer adult volunteered to do all the driving and everyone was happy.<br><br> The elementary kids got dropped off first, then Ava at her school, and then finally Lally and Lucas at the preschool, where they needed to be physically signed in. She would read a story, maybe two, then pause at the kissing window for a proper goodbye with optional pretending she couldn't see her kid . . . "Where's Lally? Oh, there she is!" Jesus, did they ever get tired of that? Then she was free. Free to go to the store. Free to go home. Free to drive headfirst into the nearest wall, which was what she might have done, if she didn't have to go back in three hours and pick up Lucas and Lally. Frances wondered how many other people were overwhelmed by anticlimax but kept plodding along, taking care of their kids, picking up juice box straws so animals wouldn't choke on them, collecting corks or buttons or whatever craft supply was needed, replacing the batteries in the smoke alarm as soon as the first <i>ping</i> of complaint was registered. Maybe this was what they meant by staying together for the children. It had nothing to do with marriage at all.<br> Frances pulled into the elementary school lot and Ava got out, sighing as if she were a fourteen-year-old Victorian child disembarking for her day down the mine. She pulled open the door and swung her arm wide.<br><br> "Medium-size children may now escape. Mind the gap, and watch out for speeding moms on cell phones."<br><br> The children had already unbuckled and piled out, high-fiving Ava as they passed her. Kate stopped, and Frances turned to see what was up. The little girl's face was a study in conflict.<br><br> "What's wrong, honey?"<br><br> Kate looked at Frances, and her chin wobbled.<br><br> "I left my toilet roll tubes at home."<br><br> "Oh." Frances looked at her eldest child. Ava shrugged, looking back inside the open minivan.<br><br> "They aren't in the car."<br><br> "Oh, OK." Frances smiled at Kate. "I'm sure the teacher will have lots of extras." She herself had, over time, sent in three thousand toilet roll tubes. For all she knew they were building a particle collider out of them, or an accurate re-creation of the New York subway system. Let's hope they didn't use the obvious choice for subway trains.<br><br> "No, I have to have my <i>own</i> ones." Kate's eyes were filling with tears, her shit-fit indicator was dropping to DEFCON 3. "It's for the class project. Everyone else will have them."<br><br> Frances weighed her options. On the one hand Kate was only six, and would not only survive but would forget the trauma of not having had toilet roll tubes. But on the other hand, she was a member of the Yakuza-esque organization known as Miss Lollio's First Grade Class, whose members fell on the weakest like wolves on a lamb. Forgetting to bring toilet roll tubes and having to borrow some was a Noticeable Event to be avoided at all costs. It wasn't on the level of peeing oneself, of course, it wasn't going to give rise to a nickname you couldn't shake until college, but it wasn't great.<br><br> "My mommy put them in a bag, but she forgot to give them to me." A note of accusatory steel had entered her voice. Frances gazed at the little angel, whose mother had been heard calling her Butterblossom. Kate's eyes had gone flat like a shark's. She knew she would get what she wanted, the only question was when.<i> I am younger than you, old lady, her eyes said, and I will stand here until age makes you infirm, at which time I will push you down, crunch over your brittle bones, and get the toilet roll tubes I need.</i><br><br> "Alright, Kate. I'll go back and get them after I drop Ava, OK, and bring them back to school for you." Frances knew she was being played, but it was OK. She was softhearted, and she could live with that.<br><br> "Suck<i>ah</i> . . ." Ava headed back to her seat, shaking her head over her mother's weakness, a weakness she loved to take advantage of herself.<br><br> "Thanks, Frances!" Kate beamed an enormous smile, turned, and ran off-the transformation from tremulous waif to bouncy cherub instantaneous. Behind her in the line of cars, someone tapped their horn. OK, the brief honk said, we waited while you dealt with whatever mini crisis was caused by your piss-poor parenting, because we're nice like that, but now you can get a move on because we, like everyone else in this line, have Shit to Do. Amazing how much a second of blaring horn can communicate.<br><br> Frances waved an apologetic hand out of the car window and pulled out of the gate.<br><br> She dropped the other kids and was back at Anne's house in a half hour. Having carpool duty wasn't the onerous task the other parents thought it was: All three schools were close to home, and all four families lived on the same block. As Frances ran up to Anne's door she looked over and saw her own cat, Carlton, watching her. She waved. He blinked and looked away, embarrassed for both of them.<br><br> She knocked softly on the door, but no one answered. Maybe Anne had gone back to sleep. She turned the handle and pushed open the door, peering around. Yup, there was the bag of toilet roll tubes. She grabbed it and was about to shut the door again when she saw Anne lying on the floor, her face turned away, her long hair spilling across the rug.<br><br> "Anne! Holy crap, are you OK?" But as she said it her brain started processing what she was really seeing. Anne, on the floor, check. But now she'd turned her head and Frances realized she was fine. In fact, she was better than fine. Frances had instinctively stepped over the sill and now she saw that Anne was naked, her face flushed, a man between her legs, his head below her waist.<br><br> "Shit . . ." Frances dropped her eyes, began to back out. "Sorry, Anne, Kate forgot her toilet roll tubes . . ." Stupidly she raised her hand with the Whole Foods bag in it because, of course, that would make it better, that she'd interrupted Anne and Charlie having a quickie on the living room floor. It was OK, because she was just here for the toilet roll tubes. Nothing to see here, move along.<br><br> The man realized something was wrong, finally, and raised his head, looking first at Anne and then turning to see what she was looking at, why her face was so pale when seconds before it had been so warmly flushed.<br><br> Frances was nearly through the door, it was closing fast, but not before she saw that it wasn't Charlie at all. It was someone else entirely.</p><h2>Preventing Ministry Failure: A ShepherdCare Guide for Pastors, Ministers and Other Caregivers</h2><p>Great ministers don't just happen. Great falls from ministry don't just happen either. A complex mix of factors both internal and external test the limits of your ability to minister wholeheartedly over the long haul. Senior pastor Brad Hoffmann and licensed professional counselor Michael Todd Wilson work with pastors removed from their place of service. The common experiences of these pastors revealed patterns that consistently contributed to burnout, ineffectiveness and moral failure. If such patterns can be predicted, the authors reasoned, can they be <em>prevented?</em><em>Preventing Ministry Failure</em> is a personal guidebook for pastors and other caregivers to prepare them to withstand common pressures and to flourish in the ministry God has called them to. Work through the exercises and reflections individually or in conversation with your peers, and you'll find yourself better equipped for the challenges of vocational ministry, and more conscious of the presence of God leading you on and restoring your soul.</p><p><strong>Michael Todd Wilson</strong> is a licensed professional counselor and cofounder of ShepherdCare. He is the coauthor of <em>Soul Virgins: Redefining Single Sexuality</em> (Baker Books).Highly recommended for not only those who are Christian leaders, but also for those who have that aspiration. (M. G. Paregian, The Paregian Information and Referral Directory, July 2009)<br><br>Wilson and Hoffmann give pastors a practical plan they can apply to their lives. Ministers can adopt these <em>action points</em> as they work toward healthy and happy marriages and families while serving in minstry for a lifetime. (Wayde Goodall, enrichment, Winter 2009)<br><br>Drawing upon years of experience in counseling pastoral leaders, Michael Todd Wilson and Brad Hoffman offer their insights to those facing challenges in ministry. <em>Preventing Ministry Failure</em> is a workbook for Christian leaders providing practical advice to pastors who are experieincing trials - or simply hoping to avoid them. As they discuss topics ranging from intimacy and stress management to establshing proper boundaries and dealing with transitions, scarecly any aspect of ministry is left unmentioned. Each section is filled with helpful questions for reflection. (David Rogers, Ministry Today, (ministrytodaymag.com), October 2008)<br><br>This book is from the heart of two men who care deeply about the ministry and those who minister. Application is practical. I recommend that pastors use this practical tool to do an "inventory check" on their lives and perform some preventative maintenance before they find themselves in the throes of a failed ministry. (Douglas Brown, SharperIron Book Reviews, May 15, 2008)<br><br>. . .a great encouragement to those in vocational Christian service. The self-care measures in this book should go a long way in helping Christian minstry workers care for themselves. (The Baptist Bulletin, March/April 2008)<br><br>"Pastors need relationships with other pastors. It's that simple. This book provides a great resource for a small group of pastors to go through together. The material focuses on seven common precursors to ministry failure, including lack of meaningful relationships, inadequate stress-management skills, and underdeveloped leadership skills. Besides being ideal for small groups of ministers (or church staff members), it's also a nice guide for a more experienced pastor to go through with a novice pastor in a mentoring session." (Rick Warren's Ministry Toolbox)<br><br>"Drawing upon years of experience in counseling pastoral leaders, Michael Todd Wilson and Brad Hoffman offer their insights to those facing challenges in ministry. . . . [S]carcely any aspect of ministry is left unmentioned. Each section is filled with helpful questions for reflection." (Ministry Today, November/December 2007)<br><br>"The Bible clearly tells us that in this world we will have trouble, and those in ministry are not exempt from it. We all experience trials and temptations, and are faced with difficult choices related to our human struggles. Michael Todd Wilson and Brad Hoffmann understand this and have done an excellent job sharing a biblical perspective on avoiding the all-too-common pitfalls of ministry that can lead to destruction. The wisdom and insight found in this book has helped me become a more effective leader and minister." (Alan Chambers, President, Exodus International)<br><br>"Thirty years ago the moral failure of my second senior pastor forced me to start working with adultery in ministry. I wish I had had this material then. After years of everyone telling us pastors that we need to be in a small group where we can be open and vulnerable, Michael Todd Wilson and Brad Hoffmann finally provide for us a guide that not only tells us but shows us how to do that. I know of nothing else like it for those of us in vocational Christian ministry, and I can't wait to use it in my own group." (Dave Carder, author of Torn Asunder: Recovering from Extramarital Affairs)<br><br>"In a day where senior pastors and ministers alike are reading, collecting and gathering materials from books, CDs and seminars for the benefit of someone else, Brad Hoffmann and Michael Todd Wilson have written an excellent self-help book for the minister himself. These seven reasons why ministers struggle, quit, resign or are forced out of ministry have been identified and analyzed, and a course of action recommended for the health and happiness of the minister's home and family.<br><br> The book moves beyond the theory to the practical. Trust me, these two have been there, done that and bought the shirt."

Granted the power of speech centuries earlier by the revered Bruce Webster, the intelligent, pacifist dogs are the last keepers of human history, raising their pups with bedtime stories, passed down through generations, of the lost &#x201c;websters&#x201d; who gave them so much but will never return. With the aid of Jenkins, an ageless service robot, the dogs live in a world of harmony and peace. But they now face serious threats from their own and other dimensions, perhaps the most dangerous of all being the reawakened remnants of a warlike race called &#x201c;Man.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the Golden Age of Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein, Clifford D. Simak&#x2019;s writing blazed as brightly as anyone&#x2019;s in the science fiction firmament. Winner of the International Fantasy Award, <i>City </i>is a magnificent literary metropolis filled with an astonishing array of interlinked stories and structures&#x2014;at once dystopian, transcendent, compassionate, and visionary.</p><p>During his fifty-five-year career, CLIFFORD D. SIMAK produced some of the most iconic science fiction stories ever written. Born in 1904 on a farm in southwestern Wisconsin, Simak got a job at a small-town newspaper in 1929 and eventually became news editor of the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune,</i>&nbsp;writing fiction in his spare time.<br><br> Simak was best known for the book&nbsp;<i>City</i>,&nbsp;a reaction to the horrors of World War II, and for his novel&nbsp;<i>Way Station.&nbsp;</i>In 1953&nbsp;<i>City</i>&nbsp;was awarded the International Fantasy Award, and in following years, Simak won three Hugo Awards and a Nebula Award. In 1977 he became the third Grand Master of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, and before his death in 1988, he was named one of three inaugural winners of the Horror Writers Association&#x2019;s Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement.<br> &nbsp;<br> DAVID W. WIXON was a close friend of Clifford D. Simak&#x2019;s. As Simak&#x2019;s health declined, Wixon, already familiar with science fiction publishing, began more and more to handle such things as his friend&#x2019;s business correspondence and contract matters. Named literary executor of the estate after Simak&#x2019;s death, Wixon began a long-term project to secure the rights to all of Simak&#x2019;s stories and find a way to make them available to readers who, given the fifty-five-year span of Simak&#x2019;s writing career, might never have gotten the chance to enjoy all of his short fiction. Along the way, Wixon also read the author&#x2019;s surviving journals and rejected manuscripts, which made him uniquely able to provide Simak&#x2019;s readers with interesting and thought-provoking commentary that sheds new light on the work and thought of a great writer.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;To read science-fiction is to read Simak. The reader who does not like Simak stories does not like science-fiction at all.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robert A. Heinlein<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just about any work by Simak deserves to be considered a classic and <i>City</i> is no exception.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Don't miss a single book in this stunning paranormalseries from New York Times bestselling author Gena Showalter!</em><br><br> All her life, Ashlyn Darrow has been tormented by voices from the past. To end the nightmare, she has come to Budapestseeking help from men rumored to have supernatural abilities, not knowing she'll be sweptinto the arms of Maddox, their most dangerous member&#x2014;a man trapped in a hell of his own.<br><br>Neither can resist the instant hunger that calms their torments...and ignites anirresistible passion. But every heated touch and burning kiss will edge them closer todestruction&#x2014;and a soul-shattering test of love...<br><br>Book 1 of Lords of the Underworld.</p><p>Gena is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 25 books.<br><br>Every night death came, slowly, painfully, and every morning Maddox awoke in bed, knowing he'd have to die again later. That was his greatest curse and his eternal punishment.<br><br>He ran his tongue over his teeth, wishing it were a blade over his enemy's throat instead. Most of the day had already passed. He'd heard the time seep away, a poisonous tick-tock in his mind, every beat of the clock a mocking reminder of mortality and pain.<br><br>In little more than an hour, the first sting would pierce his stomach and nothing he did, nothing he said, would change that. Death <em>would</em> come for him.<br><br>"Damned gods," he muttered, increasing the speed of his bench presses.<br><br>"Bastards, every one of them," a familiar male voice said from behind him.<br><br>Maddox's motions didn't slow at Torin's unwelcome intrusion. Up. Down. Up. Down. For two hours he had worked out his frustration and anger on the punching bag, the treadmill and now the weights. Sweat ran from his bare chest and arms, riding the ropes of his muscles in clear rivulets. He should be as exhausted mentally as he was physically, but his emotions were only growing darker, more powerful.<br><br>"You should not be here," he said.<br><br>Torin sighed. "Look. I didn't mean to interrupt, but something's happened."<br><br>"So take care of it."<br><br>"I can't."<br><br>"Whatever it is, try. I'm in no shape to help." These last few weeks very little was needed to send him into a killing haze where no one around him was safe. Even his friends. <em>Especially</em> his friends. He didn't want to, never meant to, but was sometimes helpless against urges to strike and to maim.<br><br>"Maddox&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'm at the edge, Torin," he croaked. "I would do more harm than good."<br><br>Maddox knew his limitations, had known them for thousands of years. Ever since that doomed day the gods had chosen a woman to perform a task that should have been his.<br><br>Pandora had been strong, yes, the strongest female soldier of their time. But he had been stronger. More capable. Yet he had been deemed too weak to guard <em>dimOuniak,</em> a sacred box housing demons so vile, so destructive, they could not even be trusted in Hell.<br><br>As if Maddox would have allowed it to be destroyed. Frustration had bloomed inside him at the affront. Inside all of them, every warrior now living here. They had fought diligently for the king of the gods, killed expertly and protected thoroughly; they should have been chosen as guards. That they hadn't was an embarrassment not to be tolerated.<br><br>They'd only thought to teach the gods a lesson the night they'd stolen <em>dimOuniak</em> from Pandora and released that horde of demons upon the unsuspecting world. How foolish they had been. Their plan to prove their power had failed, for the box had gone missing in the fray, leaving the warriors unable to recapture a single evil spirit.<br><br>Destruction and havoc had soon reigned, plunging the world into darkness until the king of the gods finally intervened, cursing each warrior to house a demon inside <em>himself.</em><br><br>A fitting punishment. The warriors had unleashed the evil to avenge their stinging pride; now they would contain it.<br><br>And so the Lords of the Underworld were born.<br><br>Maddox had been given Violence, the demon who was now as much a part of him as his lungs or his heart. Now, man could no longer live without demon and demon could no longer function without man. They were woven together, two halves of a whole.<br><br>From the very first, the creature inside him had beckoned him to do malicious things, hated things, and he'd been compelled to obey. Even when led to slay a woman&#x2014;to slay Pandora. His fingers clenched the bar so tightly his knuckles nearly snapped out of place. Over the years he had learned to control some of the demon's more vile compulsions, but it was a constant struggle and he knew he could shatter at any moment.<br><br>What he would have given for a single day of calm. No overpowering desire to hurt others. No battles within himself. No worries. No death. Just...peace.<br><br>"It's not safe for you here," he told his friend, who still stood in the doorway. "You need to leave." He set the silver bar atop its perch and sat up. "Only Lucien and Reyes are allowed to be close to me during my demise." And only because they played a part in it, unwilling though they were. They were as helpless against their demons as Maddox was his.<br><br>"About an hour until that happens, so.. " Torin threw a rag at him. "I'll take my chances."<br><br>Maddox reached behind his back, caught the white cloth and turned. He wiped his face. "Water."<br><br>An ice-cold bottle was soaring through the air before the second syllable left his mouth. He caught it deftly, moisture splashing his chest. He drained the icy contents and studied his friend.<br><br>As usual, Torin wore all black and gloves covered his hands. Pale hair fell in waves to his shoulders, framing a face mortal females considered a sensual feast. They didn't know the man was actually a devil in angel's skin. They should have, though. He practically glowed with irreverence, and there was an unholy gleam in his green eyes that proclaimed he would laugh in your face while cutting out your heart. Or laugh in your face while you cut out <em>his</em> heart.<br><br>To survive, he had to find humor where he could. They all did.<br><br>Like every resident of this Budapest fortress, Torin was damned. He might not die every night like Maddox, but he could never touch a living thing, skin to skin, without infecting it with sickness.<br><br>Torin was possessed by the spirit of Disease.<br><br>He hadn't known a woman's touch in over four hundred years. He'd learned his lesson well when he'd given in to lust and caressed a would-be lover's face, bringing about a plague that decimated village after village. Human after human.<br><br>"Five minutes of your time," Torin said, his determination clear. "That's all I'm asking."<br><br>"Think we'll be punished for insulting the gods today?" Maddox replied, ignoring the request. If he didn't allow himself to be asked for a favor, he didn't have to feel guilty for turning it down.<br><br>His friend uttered another of those sighs. "Our every breath is supposed to be a punishment."<br><br>True. Maddox's lips curled into a slow, razored smile as he peered ceilingward. <em>Bastards. Punish me further, I dare you.</em> Maybe then, finally, he would fade to nothingness.<br><br>He doubted the gods would concern themselves, though. After bestowing the death-curse upon him, they had ignored him, pretending not to hear his pleas for forgiveness and absolution. Pretending not to hear his promises and desperate bargaining.<br><br>What more could they do to him, anyway?<br><br>Nothing could be worse than dying over and over again. Or being stripped of anything good and right...or hosting the spirit of Violence inside his mind and body.<br><br>Jackknifing to his feet, Maddox tossed the now-wet rag and empty water bottle into the nearest hamper. He strode to the far end of the room and braced his hands above his head, leaning into the semicircular alcove of stained-glass windows and staring into the night through the only clear partition.<br><br>He saw Paradise.<br><br>He saw hell.<br><br>He saw freedom, prison, everything and nothing. He saw...home.<br><br>Situated atop a towering hill as the fortress was, he had a direct view of the city. Lights glowed brightly, pinks, blues and purples illuminating the murky velvet sky, glinting off the Danube River and framing the snowcapped trees that dominated the area. Wind blustered, snowflakes dancing and twirling through the air.<br><br>Here, he and the others had a modicum of privacy from the rest of the world. Here, they were allowed to come and go without having to face a barrage of questions. <em>Why don't you age? Why do screams echo through the forest every night? Why do you sometimes look like a monster?</em><br><br>Here, the locals maintained their distance, awed, respectful. "Angels," he'd even heard whispered during a rare encounter with a mortal.<br><br>If they only knew.<br><br>Maddox's nails elongated slightly, digging into the stone. Budapest was a place of majestic beauty, old-world charm and modern pleasures, but he'd always felt removed from it. From the castle district that lined one street to the nightclubs that lined the next. From the fruits and vegetables hawked in one alley to the living flesh hawked in the other.<br><br>Maybe that sense of disconnection would vanish if he ever explored the city, but unlike the others who roamed at will, he was trapped inside the fortress and surrounding land as surely as Violence had been trapped inside Pandora's box thousands of years ago.<br><br>His nails lengthened farther, almost claws now. Thinking of the box always blackened his mood. <em>Punch a wall,</em> Violence beckoned. <em>Destroy something. Hurt, kill.</em> He would have liked to obliterate the gods. One by one. Decapitate them, perhaps. Rip out their blackened, decayed hearts, definitely.<br><br>The demon purred in approval.<br><br><em>Of course it's purring now,</em> Maddox thought with disgust. Anything bloodthirsty, no matter the victims, met with the creature's support. Scowling, he leveled another heated glance at the heavens. He and the demon had been paired long ago, but he remembered the day clearly. The screams of the innocent in his ears, humans bleeding all around him, hurting, dying, the spirits having devoured their flesh in a rapturous frenzy.<br><br>Only when Violence had been shoved inside his body did he lose touch with reality. There had been no sounds, no sights. Just an all-consuming darkness. He hadn't regained his senses until Pandora's blood splattered his chest, her last breath echoing in his ears.<br><br>She had not been his first kill&#x2014;or his last&#x2014;but she had been the first and only woman to meet his sword. The horror of seeing that once-vibrant female form broken and knowing he was responsible for it... To this day, he had not assuaged the guilt, the regret. The shame and the sorrow.<br><br>He'd sworn to do whatever was necessary to control the spirit from then on, but it had been too late. Enraged all the more, Zeus had bestowed a second curse upon him: every night at midnight he would die exactly as Pandora had died&#x2014;a blade through the stomach, six hellish times. The only difference was, her torment had ended within minutes.<br><br><em>His</em> torment would last for eternity.<br><br>He popped his jaw, trying to relax against a new onslaught of aggression. It wasn't as if he were the only one to suffer, he reminded himself. The other warriors had their own demons&#x2014;literally and figuratively. Torin, of course, was keeper of Disease. Lucien was keeper of Death. Reyes, of Pain. Aeron, of Wrath. Paris, of Promiscuity.<br><br>Why couldn't <em>he</em> have been given that last one? He would have been able to journey to town anytime he wished, take any woman he desired, savoring every sound, every touch.<br><br>As it was, he could never venture far. Nor could he trust himself around females for long periods of time. If the demon overtook him or if he could not return home before midnight and someone found his dead, bloody body and buried him&#x2014;or worse, burned him.<br><br>How he wished such a thing would end his miserable existence. He would have left long ago and allowed himself to be roasted in a pit. Or perhaps he would have jumped from the fortress's highest window and smashed his brains from his skull. But no. No matter what he did, he'd merely awaken once again, charred as well as sore. Broken as well as sliced.<br><br>"You've been staring at that window for a while," Torin said. "Aren't you even curious as to what's happened?"<br><br>Maddox blinked as he was dragged from his thoughts.<br><br>"You're still here?"<br><br>His friend arched a black brow, the color a startling contrast to his silver-white hair. "I believe the answer to my question is no. Are you calm now, at least?"<br><br>Was he ever truly calm? "As calm as a creature like me can be."<br><br>"Stop whining. There's something I need to show you, and don't try to deny me this time. We can talk about my reason for disturbing you along the way." Without another word, Torin spun on his booted heel and strode from the room.<br><br>Maddox remained in place for several seconds, watching his friend disappear around the corner. <em>Stop whining,</em> Torin had said. Yes, that's exactly what he had been doing. Curiosity and wry amusement pushed past his lethal mood, and Maddox stepped from the gym into the hallway. A cold draft of air swirled around him, thick with moisture and the crisp scents of winter. He spied Torin a few feet away and stalked forward, quickly closing in.<br><br>"What's this about?"<br><br>"Finally. Interest," was the only response.<br><br>"If this is one of your tricks..." Like the time Torin had ordered hundreds of blow-up dolls and placed them throughout the fortress, all because Paris had foolishly complained about the lack of female companionship in town. The plastic "ladies" had stared out from every corner, their wide eyes and let-me-suck-you mouths taunting everyone who passed them.<br><br>Things like that happened when Torin was bored.<br><br>"I wouldn't waste my time trying to trick you," Torin said without turning to face him. "You, my friend, have no sense of humor."<br><br>True.<br><br>As Maddox kept pace, stone walls stretched at his sides; sconces glowed, pulsing with light and fire, twining shadow with gold. The House of the Damned, as Torin had dubbed the place, had been built hundreds of years ago. Though they had modernized it as best they could, the age showed in the crumbling rock and the scuffed floors.<br><br>"Where is everyone?" Maddox asked, only then realizing he hadn't spotted any of the others.<br><br>"You'd think Paris would be shopping for food since our cabinets are nearly bare and that's his only duty, but no. He's out searching for a new woman."<br><br>Lucky bastard. Possessed as he was by Promiscuity, Paris could not bed the same woman twice, and so he seduced a new one&#x2014;or two or three&#x2014;every day. The only downside? If he couldn't find a woman, he was reduced to doing things Maddox didn't even want to contemplate. Things that left the normally good-tempered man hunched over a toilet, heaving the contents of his stomach. Though Maddox's envy abated at such moments, it always returned when Paris spoke of one of his lovers. The soft brush of a thigh...the meeting of hot skin...the groans of ecstasy.<br><br>"Aeron is... Prepare yourself," Torin began, "because this is the main reason I hunted you down."<br><br>"Did something happen to him?" Maddox demanded as darkness shuttered over his thoughts and anger overtook him. <em>Destroy, obliterate,</em> Violence beseeched, clawing at the corners of his mind. "Is he hurt?"<br><br>Immortal Aeron might be, but he could still be harmed. Even killed&#x2014;a feat they had all discovered in the worst possible way.<br><br>"Nothing like that," Torin assured him.<br><br>Slowly, he relaxed and gradually Violence receded. "What, then? Cleaning a mess and throwing a fit?" Every warrior here had specific responsibilities. It was their way of maintaining some semblance of order amid the chaos of their own souls. Aeron's task was maid service, something he complained about ...</p><h2>Breaking the Code: A True Story by a Hells Angel President and the Cop Who Pursued Him</h2><p>A highly respected Hells Angel president.

Later that night, Gary locks Michelle in a cage, tortures her repeatedly, and uses her to quench his voracious and deviant sexual whims. Little does she know that this will become her new reality for the next six years. Stevens can also pinpoint the moment she reconstituted the splintered pieces of her life: She's in cap and gown, receiving her Ph.D. in psychology--and the university's award for best dissertation.<br><br>The distance between these two points is the improbable journey from torture, loss, and mental illness to healing, recovery, and triumph that is Stevens's powerful memoir, <i>Scared Selfless</i>. In this harrowing tale, Stevens, who was inspired to help others heal by becoming a psychotherapist, sheds light on the all-too-real threat of child sexual abuse, its subsequent psychological effects, and the best methods for victims to overcome their ordeals and, ultimately, thrive. <i>Scared Selfless</i> is both an examination of the extraordinary feats of the mind that are possible in the face of horrific trauma and Stevens's courageous testament to their power.</p><p><b>Dr. Michelle Stevens,</b> a psychologist, is the founder and director of Post-Traumatic Success, a nonprofit that educates and inspires those affected by psychological trauma. She studied writing at New York University before earning her doctorate from Saybrook University, where her thesis was honored as the Dissertation of Distinction.

Her account of childhood trauma&#x2014;told with candor and, yes, even wit&#x2014;and how she found the strength and resilience to ultimately recover and triumph is an inspiration not just to other survivors, but to us all.

This is a story about the psychological legacy of abuse, the struggle to survive a troubled mind, the challenges of finding elusive help and about finally and triumphantly finding redemption through the most unapologetic example of personal grit I&#x2019;ve ever read.

This book does more to explain what it feels like to live with the effects of trauma than anything I've ever read. It's the rare book that's both personal and clinical. It should be a resource and an inspiration not just to survivors but to those who love and seek to understand them.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Sara Corbett, co-author of <i>A House in the Sky<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;What an astonishing and extraordinary book!

Then I told five friends, 'You have to read this book.' Now I am telling you&#x2014;'You have to read this book.' &nbsp;It is a story that has to be told.

His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.<p>It drove him through the years of teaching, designing greeting cards and stage sets, and painting church murals until 1965, when he illustrated his first children's book, <i>Sound</i>, by Lisa Miller for Coward-McCann. Eventually, freed of other obligations, he plunged full time into both writing and illustrating children's books.</p><p>He names Fra Angelico and Giotto, Georges Rouault, and Ben Shahn as major influences on his work, but he soon found his own unique style. His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for <i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion.

In tightly framed paintings, the boy helps ready the nursery; draws and cuts paper decorations (his signature birds, hearts, and flowers); and eagerly awaits Aunt Nell's arrival. However, when his mother goes to the hospital, it is his forceful and dour Italian Nana who happens to be available for baby-sitting. Worse, because chicken pox is going around, Tommy can't even visit his mother after his sister is born. But all ends well?he and his Nana patch up their quarrels, and he gets to hold Maureen when all the relatives have gathered. This title goes along with The Art Lesson (1994), Tom (1993), and Nana Upstairs &amp; Nana Downstairs (1973, all Putnam), all tales based on dePaola's memories. As a "waiting for the baby to arrive" story, though, this one seems as sedate and old-fashioned as its late-1930s setting.?Susan Hepler, Alexandria City Public Schools, VA<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beauty Water: Everyday Hydration Recipes for Wellness and Self-Care</h2><p>There is no better way to invest in wellness on a daily basis than to make sure we are drinking enough water.

Egalitarianism is heading toward an Adam who is neither male nor female, a Jesus whose manhood is not important, and a God who is both Father and Mother, and then maybe only Mother. The common denominator in all of this is a persistent undermining of the authority of Scripture in our lives. Grudem&#39;s conclusion is that we must choose either evangelical feminism or biblical truth. We can&#39;t have it both ways!</p><p><p><strong>Wayne Grudem</strong> (PhD, University of Cambridge; DD, Westminster Theological Seminary) is Distinguished Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies at Phoenix Seminary, having previously taught for twenty years at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.

In his sweeping account, Ben Kiernan broadens this vision by narrating the rich history of the peoples who have inhabited the land now known as Viet Nam over the past three thousand years. <br><br>Despite the tragedies of the American-Vietnamese conflict, Viet Nam has always been much more than a war. Its long history had been characterized by the frequent rise and fall of different political formations, from ancient chiefdoms to imperial provinces, from independent kingdoms to divided regions, civil wars, French colonies, and modern republics. In addition to dramatic political transformations, the region has been shaped by its environment, changing climate, and the critical importance of water, with rivers, deltas, and a long coastline facilitating agricultural patterns, trade, and communications. <br><br>Kiernan weaves together the many narrative strands of Viet Nam's multi-ethnic populations, including the Chams, Khmers, and Vietnamese, and its multi-religious heritage, from local spirit cults to Buddhism, Confucianism, and Catholicism. He emphasizes the peoples' interactions over the millennia with foreigners, particularly their neighbors in China and Southeast Asia, in engagements ranging from military conflict to linguistic and cultural influences. He sets the tumultuous modern period--marked by French and Japanese occupation, anticolonial nationalism, the American-Vietnamese war, and communist victory--against the continuities evident in the deeper history of the people's relationships with the lands where they have lived. In contemporary times, he explores this one-party state's transformation into a global trading nation, the country's tense diplomatic relationship with China and developing partnership with the United States in maintaining Southeast Asia's regional security, and its uncertain prospects for democracy.<br><br>Written by a leading scholar of Southeast Asia, <em>Viet Nam </em>presents an authoritative history of an ancient land.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ben Kiernan</strong> is the A. Whitney Griswold Professor of History and Professor of International and Area Studies at Yale University, where he founded the Cambodian Genocide Program and the Genocide Studies Program. He is the author of numerous books including <em>The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power and Genocide</em> <em>in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979</em> and <em>Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur</em>.<br><br>"Kiernan's dispassionate recording of the behaviour of the regional powers--Champa, Cambodia, China, India--should help to make <em>Viet Nam: A History from Earliest Times</em> a durable work."--Sophie Quinn-Judge, <em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Viet Nam</em>, Ben Kiernan synthesises three millennia of history in a beautiful book that aids the reader with numerous maps and over a dozen photographs documenting the daily life of the Vietnamese people. It is a work full of insights for students of Southeast Asia generally and, more specifically, for comparative historians and political scientists interested in nationalism, anti-colonialism, US foreign policy, and the reform and modernisation of socialism. By taking the long view, the author successfully liberates the history of Viet Nam from the reductionist view of a US military misadventure, revealing long-term trends in political organisation, culture and environmental changes." -- Vicken Cheterian, University of Geneva and Webster University Geneva, <em>Europe-Asia Studies</em><p></p><br>"Comprehensive yet readable ... It will serve the needs of both experts in Vietnamese history and general readers interested in Vietnam.... <em>Viet Nam</em>'s ability to integrate ecology into political, cultural and economic history is truly impressive." -- Michael G. Vann, <em> Asian Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"Kiernan departs from nationalist narratives to investigate the changing cultural, political, and ecological relations of the multiethnic communities that inhabited the diverse regions of Vietnam. His deep historical study exposes the folly of reducing Vietnam to a war, a metaphor of US imperialism, or the experiences of one ethnicity. Adopting a long-term approach that combines microhistory and macrohistory to decipher the multicausal forces driving historical processes, the author examines a time span of 3,000 years, beginning with the first Bronze Age chiefdoms and ending with the changing fortunes of the contemporary nation-state....The analysis is innovative for incorporating the roles of climate, water, and geography in explanations of historical continuity or change and for making ample use of archaeological and textual source materials. Valuable for both newcomers and experts in Vietnamese history. Highly recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"This ambitious survey is pathbreaking not only in its chronological scope (from prehistory to the present) and the breadth of its sources but also in its thematic reach....Although the war against the United States is an important part of Vietnam's story, it takes its place in the broad sweep of history as just one episode in a long series of struggles that people have waged over this piece of land."--Andrew J. Nathan, <em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"[In] this major new history of the country...Kiernan makes the actualities of Vietnamese life and landscape a central focus...Where Kiernan excels is in his engagement with the complex cultural and environmental factors that make the country so distinctive. In particular, he highlights the country's 'aquatic culture' from prehistoric times right up to this day...[He] makes sure that Vietnamese women themselves are heard in his narrative and are not simply defined by men...Kiernan's readiness to detect and define the significant details lurking in the sweeping historical panorama, make <em>Viet Nam</em> a major contribution to contemporary Southeast Asian scholarship...[A] sympathetic study of a tenacious and capable people."--Robin Gerster, <em>Australian Book Review</em><p></p><br>"This is a remarkably evocative, multifaceted, sophisticated, and original study not only of those groups who haltingly coalesced as Vietnamese, but also of the many peoples with whom they interacted, and indeed of an entire region during two millennia. This book, I suspect, will become a classic in Asian as well as Southeast Asian historiography."--Victor Lieberman, University of Michigan<p></p><br>"An audacious book, Kiernan's <em>Viet Nam</em> presents the country's long history to new, global audiences, eloquently showing how the deep past continues to shape and inform the present."--David Biggs, author of <em>Quagmire: Nation-Building and Nature in the Mekong Delta</em> <br><p></p><br>"This outstanding book shows that '<em>Viet Nam</em> has always been much more than a war.' By making his themes the perennial continuities and changes in the vital ecologies and polyethnic cultures of the country, Ben Kiernan tells a story of shifting layers that is lucid and rich. His work is a kaleidoscope of Vietnamese history."--Greg Lockhart, author of <em>Nation in Arms: the Origins of the People's Army of Vietnam</em><p></p><br>"Kiernan offers a comprehensive overview of Vietnamese history from prehistoric times to the 21st century...A distinctive quality of this work is its inclusion of environmental and linguistic history. The author effectively explains how geography and changing weather patterns (droughts, etc.) impacted historical development and demonstrates how changes in language over time provides information about Vietnam's past...Essential for all students of Vietnamese history. Extensive descriptions of Vietnam's relations with its neighbors also make this valuable reading for those interested in Chinese or Southeast Asian history."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>How to Make Decisions with Different Kinds of Student Assessment Data</h2><p><p>In <em>How to Make Decisions with Different Kinds of Student Assessment Data</em>, best-selling author Susan M.

This moving book tells of one such child, author Larry Loyie, and his last summer with his Cree tribe. It is a time of learning and adventure. He cares for an abandoned baby owl, watches his grandmother make winter moccasins, and sees her kill a huge grizzly with one shot. The sensitive text and Heather Holmlund&#39;s expressive illustrations beautifully capture the joy and drama of a First Nations family&#39;s last summer together.</p><p>Larry Loyie was born in Slave Lake, Alberta, where he spent his early years living a traditional Cree life. At the age of ten he was placed in St. Bernard's Mission residential school Grouard, Alberta. He is the author of several plays, short stories and children's stories dealing with native traditions, literacy and residential schools. Larry received the 2001 Canada Post Literacy Award for Individual Achievement (British Columbia). Heather D. Holmund studied fine art and the visual arts at York University, specializing in watercolour. Most recently she has focused on painting people as they relate to the natural world. From the day the authors met Heather and saw her work, the three of them shared a similar vision for this unique book, <em>As Long as the Rivers Flow</em>. Constance Brissenden is a freelance writer and editor. She is the author of nine books of travel and history.Grade 3-6-Given the appearance in recent years of books about Indian boarding schools, both fiction and nonfiction, this title offers an important perspective on the issue. Loyie shares a quiet but powerful first-person account of his last summer before he and his siblings were taken away from their family. Most of the story focuses on what was otherwise a normal seasonal routine for the Cree people of that era, with the family moving from their main cabin to their summer "camp" for a few weeks. Apart from the foreshadowed separation, this particular spring-summer progression was enlivened by the opportunity for the children to care for an orphaned baby owl, and an encounter with one of the biggest grizzly bears ever shot in North America. All of the day-to-day detail, close family bonding, and unexpected adventure draw readers comfortably into 10-year-old Lawrence's experience so that the final pages are all the more painful. When the children learn that they must go to the residential school or their parents will be imprisoned, and they are physically loaded onto the back of a truck by strangers, the sense of separation and loss is keenly felt. Holmlund's realistic and detailed watercolors expertly illuminate events throughout the story, in vignettes, plates, and a few full-page pictures. The epilogue briefly summarizes the facts about boarding schools in general, highlighting Lawrence's own experience, and includes several black-and-white photos.<br><i>Sean George, Memphis-Shelby County Public Library &amp; Information Center, Memphis, TN</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Science Comics: Cars: Engines That Move You</h2><p><p>In Dan Zettwoch's <i>Science Comics: Cars</i>, you'll learn where cars came from and how they work.

His first car was a silver 1984 Volvo 740 Turbo. <i>Science Comics: Cars</i> is his first book with First Second.Gr 4&#x2013;7-Though more of a history of automobiles than a study of their technology, this "Science Comics" entry does dive beneath the hood to highlight electrical and other systems, along with simple explanations of two- and four-cycle internal combustion engines. Zettwoch offers clear, labeled cutaway views as necessary, but he plainly takes more delight in portraying the wild and crazy variety of cars that have come down the pike over the past century and a half&#x2014;from the spidery putt-putt of Karl Benz that his intrepid wife Bertha took for a 120-mile spin in 1888 to the sleek Tesla Roadster that was sent into space with a mannequin "astronaut" behind the wheel in 2018. In between, the author treats fans to a colorful parade of experimental models, racers, popular classics, and hybrid and electrical cars, capped by exuberant galleries of commercial vehicles (no fewer than 100 types squeezed onto four teeming pages), "weird cars" like the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, head-on views of "car faces," and horns of diverse design. His closing resource list includes more systematic introductions to what he terms the "science-y stuff," as well as leads to specialty magazines, relevant comics, and comprehensive car histories. VERDICT This breezy spin through the past, present, and (near) future of cars and related vehicles speeds down a well-traveled road, but its graphic format will give it particular appeal to readers years away from learner's permits.</p><h2>Rules for Patriots: How Conservatives Can Win Again</h2><p>Conservatives in America&nbsp;need solutions&#x2013;not just values.<br><br>Time is running out on American exceptionalism.

Working with his friend Luis Spota, the editor of the cultural section of the newspaper <i>El Heraldo de M�xico</i>, Jodo initially planned 3 months&#x2019; worth of weekly comics, which he would draw himself. However, his &#x201c;Panic Fables&#x201d;--named after his early &#x2018;60s avant-garde theater movement in Paris--were met with such insatiable popularity that he continued the series for six and a half years, from June 1967 until December 1973.<br><br>Appearing for the first time in English, this book presents all 284 of Jodorowsky&#x2019;s Panic Fables in full color, along with an introduction by the author. He reveals how his first comics reflected his pessimism about the future and the meaning of life, the negativity of which soon exhausted him. He realized he needed to show the positivity that he encountered in life, and thus, little by little, he began incorporating Zen teachings, initiatory wisdom, and sacred symbology into his Panic Fables. Through this transformation and the outpouring of support from his devoted readers, many of whom cite the Panic Fables as providing pivotal guidance during their adolescence, Jodo discovered that art can serve to heal as well as raise consciousness.<br><br>Writing himself into his comics, Jodo can be glimpsed as the character of the disciple who talks with his master and, as the series progresses, gradually grows to assume the role of master, providing psychomagic solutions to the problems of everyday life. In reading the complete Panic Fables in chronological order, much like his film The Dance of Reality, we witness in colorful detail Jodorowsky&#x2019;s own path of spiritual growth.</p><p>Alejandro Jodorowsky is a playwright, filmmaker, composer, mime, psychotherapist, and author of many books on spirituality and tarot, and over thirty comic books and graphic novels. He has directed several films, including <i>The Rainbow Thief </i>and the cult classics <i>El Topo</i> and <i>The Holy Mountain</i>. He lives in France.

Years before synchronized sound became the norm, projected moving images were shown to musical accompaniment, whether performed by a lone piano player or a hundred-piece orchestra. Today film music has become its own industry, indispensable to the marketability of movies around the world. <br><br><em>Film Music: A Very Short Introduction</em> is a compact, lucid, and thoroughly engaging overview written by one of the leading authorities on the subject. After opening with a fascinating analysis of the music from a key sequence in Quentin Tarantino's <em>Reservoir Dogs</em>, Kathryn Kalinak introduces readers not only to important composers and musical styles but also to modern theoretical concepts about how and why film music works. Throughout the book she embraces a global perspective, examining film music in Asia and the Middle East as well as in Europe and the United States. Key collaborations between directors and composers--Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann, Akira Kurosawa and Fumio Hayasaka, Federico Fellini and Nino Rota, to name only a few--come under scrutiny, as do the oft-neglected practices of the silent film era. She also explores differences between original film scores and compilation soundtracks that cull music from pre-existing sources. <br><br> As Kalinak points out, film music can do many things, from establishing mood and setting to clarifying plot points and creating emotions that are only dimly realized in the images. This book illuminates the many ways it accomplishes those tasks and will have its readers thinking a bit more deeply and critically the next time they sit in a darkened movie theater and music suddenly swells as the action unfolds onscreen.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kathryn Kalinak</strong> is Professor of English and Film Studies at Rhode Island College. Her extensive writing on film music includes numerous articles as well as the books <em>Settling the Score: Music in the Classical Hollywood Film</em> and <em>How the West was Sung: Music in the Westerns of John Ford</em>.<br><br>"<em>Film Music</em> is hands down the most useful introduction to film music available. Students and general readers alike will appreciate this clear, comprehensive, short book, one of the first to approach music and cinema beyond the frame of western Europe and the U.S. Kalinak's scholarship is dazzling, her prose compelling. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the function, history, theory and practice of music in the movies."--Caryl Flinn, author of <em>Brass Diva</em> and <em>Strains of Utopia</em><p></p><br>"Kathryn Kalinak's <em>Film Music</em> is an outstanding achievement. It is extremely concise and systematic yet still manages to engage principal issues with a wide range of useful examples, and explain detailed history with worldwide coverage. This is more than a basic primer, however, it is an excellent overview of the field of film music, while being clearly-written and accessible to both students and enthusiasts alike."--Dr. K. J. Donnelly, author of <em>British Film Music and Film Musicals</em> and <em>The Spectre of Sound: Film and Television Music</em><p></p><br>"The appropriately titled <em>Film Music: A Very Short Introduction</em> is to be recommended as a very first introduction to the topic...[The author's] concise depiction, which does not limit itself to the Anglo-American realm, proves to be a successful initiation to the most essential topics of this subject area." - <em>Song and Popular Culture</em><p></p><br></p><h2>William Morris Coloring Book</h2><p>Pomegranate's William Morris coloring book features 22 arts &amp; crafts wallpaper designs by the unequalled English pattern designer.

Schaeffer wrestles with faith and disbelief, sharing his innermost thoughts with a lyricism that only great writers of literary nonfiction achieve. Schaeffer writes as an imperfect son, husband and grandfather whose love for his family, art and life trumps the ugly theologies of an angry God and the atheist vision of a cold, meaningless universe. Schaeffer writes that only when we abandon our hunt for certainty do we become free to create beauty, give love and find peace. </p> *** <p> &#x201c;As someone who has made redemption his work, Frank has, in fact, shown amazing grace.&#x201d; &#x2014; Jane Smiley, Washington Post </p> *** <p>&#x201c;To millions of evangelical Christians, the Schaeffer name is royal, and Frank is the reluctant, wayward, traitorous prince. His crime is not financial profligacy, like some pastors&#x2019; sons, but turning his back on Christian conservatives.&#x201d; &#x2014; New York Times </p> *** <p>&#x201c;Frank Schaeffer&#x2019;s gifts as a writer are sensual and loving. He&#x2019;s also laugh-out-loud funny!&#x201d; &#x2014; Andre Dubus III, author of House of Sand and Fog </p></p><p>Frank Schaeffer is a New York Times bestselling author of more than a dozen fiction and nonfiction books. Frank is a survivor of both polio and an evangelical/fundamentalist childhood, an acclaimed writer who overcame severe dyslexia, a home-schooled and self-taught documentary movie director, and a feature film director of four low-budget Hollywood features that Frank describes as &#x201c;pretty terrible.&#x201d; He is also an artist with a loyal following of collectors who own many of his oil paintings. Frank&#x2019;s three semi-biographical novels (Portofino, Zermatt and Saving Grandma) describe growing up in a fundamentalist mission and have been translated into nine languages.

That cannot obscure the fact, however&#x2014;indeed, must not be allowed to obscure the fact&#x2014;that in places this theological meditation cum memoir is arrestingly beautiful in and of itself, that it is, in fact, absolutely redolent of all the power that beautiful suggests. Schaeffer&#x2019;s openness about his own wrestling with the concepts of God and god-ness which he inherited from his parents is heartrending at times, but it is also deadly honest and always unshielded. It is also balanced in a most gentle way by Schaeffer&#x2019;s quiet defense of the traditional and his appreciation for its place in well-lived life. In fact, one leaves the final pages of WHY I AM AN ATHEIST WHO BELIEVES IN GOD aware yet once again that sometimes and in some circumstances, an artist is still the best theologian.&#x201d; &#x2014; Phyllis Tickle author of The Age of the Spirit<br><br>&#x201c;Frank Schaeffer always writes well, but Why I Am an Atheist Who Believes In God is extraordinary. Somewhere between the sterile, absolute, and empty formulae of reductionist, totalitarian science and the earnest, hostile, excessively certain make-believe of religious fundamentalism, there is a beautiful place. There is room in this place for honesty. For tenderness. For fury. For wonder. For hope. For mistakes. For paradox. For grace. This book is written from that in-between place. It will help you get there too, if you're interested in finding it.&#x201d; &#x2014; Brian D.

It is at once a wordless time-travel adventure and a meditation on the scientific theory that dinosaurs were the evolutionary ancestors of birds.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Time Flies , a wordless picture book, is inspired by the theory that birds are the modern relatives of dinosaurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This story conveys the tale of a bird trapped in a dinosaur exhibit at a natural history museum.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Eric's use of color, readers can actually see the bird enter into a mouth of a dinosaur, and then escape unscathed.<br><br><i>The New York Times Book Review</i> called <i>Time Flies</i> "a work of informed imagination and masterly storytelling unobtrusively underpinned by good science...an entirely absorbing narrative made all the more rich by its wordlessness." <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> hailed it as "a splendid debut."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Eric Rohmann's first book for children, Time Flies, was named a Caldecott Honor Book in 1995,<br> and was called a splendid debut by Kirkus Reviews.<br><br>Eric holds degrees in fine arts from Arizona State University and Illinois State University.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a former teacher, and has exhibited his artwork as numerous galleries and museums across the country.<br><br> Eric is a painter, printmaker, and a fine bookmaker, and he lives outside of Chicago.Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Yes, no--it's a metaphor! Rohmann's wordless first book shows a bird flying into a dinosaur museum one dark and stormy night. The bird flits about, perching on a dinosaur jaw and soaring on. As it flies past one particular behemoth, the bones of the creature are suddenly cloaked in flesh; the bird has entered a prehistoric landscape. A dinosaur eventually swallows the bird, but as it wings its way down the creature's throat and through its digestive system, the would-be predator is transformed to a skeleton and the bird returns once again to the museum hall. The meaning of this exercise is unclear, although a jacket note explains that Rohmann was "inspired by the theory that birds are the modern relatives of the dinosaurs." The target audience will likely be mystified. Slightly older readers, however, might be intrigued by the time-travel conceit and the scientifically minded will be wowed by Rohmann's oil paintings, which capture the textures of bone, tooth, eyeball, etc., with as much attentiveness and morbidity as, say, an 18th-century still life of gamebirds.

Nord Lafferty was already in his fifties when Reba was born, and he could deny her nothing. Over the years, he quietly settled her many scrapes with the law, but wasn't there for her when she was convicted of embezzlement and sent to the California Institution for Women. Now, at thirty-two, she's about to be paroled, having served twenty-two months of a four-year sentence. Her father wants to be sure Reba stays straight, stays home and away from the drugs, the booze, and the gamblers...<p>It seems a straightforward assignment for Kinsey: babysit Reba until she settles in, make sure she follows all the niceties of her parole. Maybe a week&#x2019;s work. Nothing untoward&#x2014;the woman seems remorseful and friendly. And the money is good.</p><p>But life is never that simple, and Reba is out of prison less than twenty-four hours when one of her old crowd comes circling round...</p></p><p>When wealthy octogenarian Nord Lafferty hires Kinsey Millhone to help his newly paroled daughter find her way back to the straight and narrow after doing time for embezzlement, the Santa Teresa P.I. has no idea what she's getting into. Reba Lafferty's ex-boss, land developer Alan Beckwith, is the man who sent her to prison--so how come she's meeting him just hours after her release, and treating Kinsey to an X-rated reunion scene played out in his parked Mercedes? And why is he also playing sex games with Reba's formerly best friend, who still works for him? A visit from an old friend from the FBI clears up the mystery--Beckwith is suspected of running a money-laundering game, and they need Reba to make their case by rolling over on him. It&#x2019;s not until Millhone presents Reba with photographic evidence of Beckwith's two-timing that she agrees to do what the Feds want... but she'll only do it her way, which could get a lot of people killed. Grafton fleshes out this well-crafted thriller with a romantic subplot involving a romantic triangle that features Kinsey's elderly landlord Henry, his brother, and a vivacious widow who can't seem to choose between them. It doesn't add much to the plot, but the fans of this evergreen series (who must be wondering what will happen to Millhone when Grafton gets to the end of the alphabet) probably won't mind a bit. <i>--Jane Adams</i>#1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author&nbsp;<b>Sue Grafton&nbsp;</b>first introduced Kinsey Millhone in the Alphabet Series in 1982.

While the exteriors of these houses are indistinguishable from traditional <i>hanok</i> built decades ago, the insides have entirely changed and adapted with the times. Korea is a nation that has radically transformed itself in recent decades, yet amidst the glass-and-steel skyscrapers and luxury apartments, the Korean design of the hanok still survives and plays a surprisingly important role. This book showcases 12 very special hanok that have been selected to reflect the Korea of today.<br><br>The original hanok design has not changed. Traditional craftsman-made materials of stone, wood, and clay are still the only components used in these houses. They also incorporate natural elements such as wind and sunlight, and <i>baesanimsu</i> (better known in its Chinese form as feng shui) is used to position the hanok in harmony with the natural forces and geographical features of the site. Each hanok has a unique story to tell, and this book studies the personality of each house from the point of view of its owners, many of whom are talented devotees of Korean architecture themselves. <br><br>Each of the Korean homes in <i>Hanok: The Korean House</i> was thoughtfully researched and photographed with the intention of giving the reader a feel for a culture reconciling its modern tendencies with its traditional roots.</p><p><b>Nani Park</b> was born in Korea, but grew up in Hawaii, which gives her the special perspective as an insider and outsider in Korea.

As an award winning illustrator and art educator, Nani has been in the art industry for over two decades.

Jones&#x2019;s I&#x2019;m Open to Anything explores bohemian Southern California of the late 1980s and early 90s, before gentrification ruined everything. The book&#x2019;s narrator flees a crumbling industrial wasteland in the Midwest and finds himself in sunny Los Angeles without a car, working in a neighborhood video store and spending many hours watching films. He explores his adopted city and befriends a number of men, most of them immigrants, who teach him the finer points of sex. He acquires the skill of fisting, giving his partners intense pleasure, and at the same time hearing the stories of their lives. They too have fled their hometowns: one to escape torture at the hands of a Salvadoran death squad; another to study anthropology after years of wandering and religious questioning. Alternating between explicit scenes of kinky sex and intimate conversations about matters of life and death, I&#x2019;m Open to Anything is a porno novel of rare ambition and humor. The book recalls Olympia Press&#x2019;s heyday, when authors made quick money churning out dirty books, but couldn&#x2019;t hide the intellectual obsessions that made them writers in the first place.<br><br> William E.

Tensions flare between Ben and his father, but they gradually learn to live together in close quarters. Then one morning the boys wake up to discover their father has disappeared&#x2014;and they are lost. What happened to him? Where are they? And what will they do when a terrible storm looms on the horizon?</p><p>M. H. Herlong lives in New Orleans, Louisiana. The author&#39;s four sons inspired this debut novel.*Starred Review* Soon after their mother&#x2019;s death, 15-year-old Ben and his two younger brothers are stunned when their father sells their home, buys a sailboat, and announces that they will live on board and cruise the Bahamas for the next year. Wrenched from everything he knows and forced to obey his father-captain&#x2019;s orders, Ben starts out angry and finds no escape. As he says, &#x201c;We were always together.&#x201d; When their father sets a course for Bermuda and disappears overboard one night, the boys have little time to wonder if he jumped or fell before they&#x2019;re struggling to stay afloat in a fierce Atlantic storm. Lost at sea in a damaged boat, they find their way to an island where they are stranded with little food, little water, and little hope of rescue. Herlong&#x2019;s first book is a great survival story and a fine portrayal of family relationships in a time of crisis. Justifiably angry, yet logical, reflective, and at times compassionate, Ben makes a sympathetic protagonist, and his brothers are no less appealing. With enough detail to make the settings real and a minimum of metaphor, the first-person narrative is clean and direct. This page-turner of an adventure story is also a convincing, compelling, and ultimately moving novel.

All of his family members who had not been evacuated died in the bombing, except for his mother, and an infant sister who died several weeks after the bombing. Compelled to tell his story in the memory of his family, Keiji Nakazawa is best known for his epic tragic history Barefoot Gen.A Note From the Author: <br><br> The atomic bomb exploded 600 meters above my hometown of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 at 8:15 a.m. I was a little over a kilometer away from the epicenter, standing at the back gate of Kanzaki Primary School, when I was hit by a terrible blast of wind and searing heat. I was six years old. I owe my life to the school's concrete wall. If I hadn't been standing in its shadow, I would have been burned to death instantly by the 5,000degree heat flash. Instead, I found myself in a living hell, the details of which remain etched in my brain as if it happened yesterday. <br> My mother, Kimiyo, was eight months pregnant. She was on the second floor balcony of our house, had just finished hanging up the wash to dry, and was turning to go back inside when the bomb exploded. The blast blew the entire balcony, with my mother on it, into the alley behind our house. Miraculously, my mother survived without a scratch. <br> The blast blew our house flat. The second floor collapsed onto the first, trapping my father, my sister Eiko, and my brother Susumu under it. My brother had been sitting in the front doorway, playing with a toy ship. His head was caught under the rafter over the doorway. He frantically kicked his legs and cried out for my mother. My father, trapped inside the house, begged my mother to do something. ...</p><h2>The Worst Princess</h2><p>Once upon a time, in a tower near you, <br><br>Lived a sad princess; the Princess Sue. <br><br>"Some day," she sighed, "my prince will come, <br><br>But I wish he'd move his royal bum." <br><br>But when Princess Sue's prince finally does arrive, he's not quite what she had in mind.

The book presents the ships chronologically, beginning with Pharaoh Khufu's Solar Barge from about 2566 BCE. The chapter includes a photograph of the reconstructed ship, discovered in 1954 near the Great Pyramid. Religious beliefs held that in the afterlife the pharaoh would need a ship to sail the cosmic waters of the sky with the sun god, Ra. </p><p> The book closes with another sun-seeking ship four thousand years later. The epitome of an ocean cruise ship, the MS <i>Allure of the Seas</i> is the biggest passenger ship ever built. An Oasis-class cruise ship, it is a destination in itself, complete with a Central Park-like oasis, 18 decks, 5,492 passengers, and a crew of 2,384. </p><p> Between these landmark vessels is a variety of ships used for all of mankind's needs, from hunters searching for food, traders with goods to barter and warriors bent on conquest, to explorers longing to see what lay beyond the horizon. Over time, the first small primitive watercraft evolved into bigger seagoing vessels, shaping our history, culture, and civilization along the way. </p><p> Some of the fifty ships are: </p><p></p><ul> <li> USS Holland, the first successful submersible vehicle, built in 1897. </li> <li> USS Enterprise, the first of the nuclear-powered supercarriers. </li> <li> SS Torrey Canyon, source of the first big oil spill at sea. </li> <li> SS Ideal X, the first container ship, which revolutionized global trade. </li> <li> USS Missouri, the US Navy's last battleship and host to the ceremony that ended World War II. </li> <li> SS Normandie, which set new standards for luxury ocean transport. </li> <li> U-21, Germany's most deadly U-boat and the first to sink a ship and survive. </li> <li> RMS Lusitania, the luxurious ocean liner whose sinking forced America into World War I. </li> <li> Mayflower, whose passengers, the Pilgrim Fathers, sailed to America. </li> <li> Zheng He's Treasure Ships, seven great fleets of ships that reached Africa. </li> <li> The Trireme, a fine example of a pre-Viking Nordic vessel. </li> <li> Amistad, overtaken by its slave passengers. </li> <li> SS Great Britain, the first transoceanic ship. </li> <li> Bismark, one of the most powerful battleships of World War II, defeated by a biplane. </li> </ul><p></p><p> The concise text is highlighted by elegant reproductions, photographs, and sidebars, paintings, ship plans, quotes and photographs. </p><p> This attractive reference provides an innovative perspective on maritime and world history. It is an excellent selection for all collections. </p></p><p><p> Ian Graham is an author with more than 30 years' experience in popular science, technology and history.

Animals, writes Emmanuelle Pouydebat, are lyric poets; they discover and shape the world when they sing, dance, explore, and reproduce. The animal kingdom has been evolving for millions of years, weathering many crises of extinction; this book allows us to draw inspiration from animals' enduring vitality.</p><p>Pouydebat's text, accompanied by striking color illustrations by artist Julie Terrazzoni, offers a catalog of wondrous beings. Pouydebat describes the African bush elephant&#x2015;the biggest land mammal of them all, but the evolutionary descendant of a tiny animal that stood less than fifty centimeters (nineteen inches) high sixty million years ago; the scaly, toothless pangolin, the world's most endangered mammal&#x2015;and perhaps its most atypical; the red-lipped batfish, which walks, rather than swims, across the ocean floor; and the great black cockatoo, a gifted percussionist. Chimpanzees, she tells us, self-medicate with medicinal plants; the jellyfish, under stress, reverts to juvenile polyp-hood; and the sweetly named honey badger feeds on reptiles, termites, scorpions, and earthworms. </p><p>Pouydebat, a researcher at the French Museum of Natural History, and Terrazzoni capture the astonishment promised by any excursion into nature&#x2015;the happiness that comes from watching a dragonfly, spider, frog, lizard, elephant, parrot, mouse, orangutan, or ladybug. It's the joy of witnessing life itself. We need only open our eyes to see.</p></p><p>Emmanuelle Pouydebat is a permanent researcher employed by the CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research), working at the Mus�um National d&#39;Histoire Naturelle in Paris.</p><h2>The Insect World of J.

Welch offer a personal, in-depth, and entertaining account of some of the great stories gathered during their years as participants in one of the most important plant-hunting efforts of the twentieth century&#x2014;the quest to save antique roses that disappeared from the market in a notoriously trend-driven business.<br><br> By the 1950s, almost exclusively, modern roses (those with one compact bloom at the top of a large stem) were grown for the cut-flower market. The large rounded shrubs and billowy fence climbers known to our grandparents and great-grandparents in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had been reduced to this rather monotonous single style of plant.<br><br> Yet those roses of old still grew, tough and persistent, in farmyards, cemeteries, vacant lots, and abandoned fields. The rediscovery of these antiques and the subsequent movement to conserve them became the mission of &#x201c;rose rustlers,&#x201d; dedicated rosarians who studied, sought, cut, and cultivated these hardy survivors.<br><br> Here, the authors chronicle their own origins, adventures, and discoveries as part of a group dubbed the Texas Rose Rustlers. They present tales of the many efforts that have helped restore lost roses not only to residential gardens, but also to commercial and church landscapes in Texas. Their experiences and friendships with other figures in the heirloom rose world bring an insider&#x2019;s perspective to the lore of &#x201c;rustling,&#x201d; the art of propagation, and the continued fascination with the world&#x2019;s favorite flower.</p><p>GREG GRANT is the Smith County horticulturist for the Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service in Tyler.

In "Before Our Very Eyes," he shares the inside story of the 21st century regime change wars. He lays bare the "Arab Spring," the "revolutions" against Gaddafi and Assad, and the rapid rise of the jihadist monster ISIS, as masked operations of the US empire, "leading from behind." In "Before Our Very Eyes" he chronicles the onslaught against Syria and Libya, from the viewpoints of three camps: the foolish ambitions of the French neocolonialists, the fanaticism of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the lust for world domination of the Anglo-Zionist-American Empire. We see how the Anglo-American axis (the US, UK, and Israel discreetly behind the scenes) deployed their iron grip on the world's money and media to propagate a fake scenario of human rights violations. This was the cover story for the real scheme -- to utterly disable the Muslim world by bringing it under the sword of fanatics like the Brotherhood, Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Vassal regimes like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and the Emirates were assigned to do the heavy lifting. For public relations purposes, the US pretended to fight half-heartedly against ISIS &#x2013; which in fact it had intentionally created in Iraq, to divide and conquer the insurgency. The US then covertly ferried the terrorists into Libya and Syria. It continues to prop up ISIS by devious means. Thus the wars on Libya and Syria were based on treachery and fakery from start to finish &#x2013; but the suffering of millions of innocent victims is all too real. A most murderous masquerade!</p><p>Thierry Meyssan shocked the world with the first &#34;9/11 Truth&#34; books, his L&#39;Effroyable Imposture in March 2002 (9/11: The Big Lie), and a sequel, Pentagate. In the 1990&#39;s he was national secretary of a French radical party which held seats in the government. He is the founder of the Voltaire Network, a major alternative international press agency. In 2005, he organized the Axis for Peace, a congress of international leaders and writers opposing illegal wars. In 2007, he was forced into exile and settled in the Middle East, where he has witnessed and participated in history in the making. He has been called France&#39;s most controversial public figure, and is the only Western observer to remain on the scene in Libya and Syria during the entire conflict. In 2011 Meyssan went to Tripoli and was appointed by Gaddafi to mobilize international support against the aggression that would destroy the Libyan republic; but the NATO onslaught came too quickly, and he narrowly escaped with his life. He is currently consultant to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&#39;s government, and has been close to heads of state like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran.<p>Extraordinary, a real initiation into politics, easy to read.<br> Fascinating panorama of geopolitics by an incorruptible eyewitness.<br> Very enlightening.

It takes the reader on a journey through a series of hidden influences that shape their decisions about what research question to ask. Beginning with the reader&#39;s own interest in research topics, each chapter then systematically delves deeper into the reasons behind that choice and the beliefs and values that should be embedded in the research question in order for the researcher&#39;s attention, motivation, and commitment to be sustained. Chapters examine personal experiences with music, health, and well-being; assumptions about why music, health, and well-being fit together in the first place; beliefs about what kinds of research are most powerful; and contextual influences, such as organizational culture, policies, and emerging social movements. In the final chapter, readers have the opportunity to synthesize their reflections on each of these topics in a way that leads directly to their own unique research question.</p><p></p><h2>Poetry Handbook: A Dictionary of Terms</h2><p><p> The classic reference work&#x2014;an invaluable sourcebook for poets and readers </p></p><p>[ A ] <p><b>abstract poem </b>A term used by Dame Edith Sitwell for verse that depends chiefly upon its auditory values for its meaning. Such poetry is analogous to abstract painting in which the arrangement of colors and shapes is significant though no physical objects are represented. Words are employed with little regard for their usual connotations, but rather for their aural effectiveness in a pattern of full and approximate rhymes and in the manipulation of rhythm. Her own poems in the collection called Facade exemplify the type, which may be illustrated by three lines from her lively "Hornpipe" where, we hear, the dumb</p><p>Sky rhinoceros-glum</p><p>Watched the courses of the breakers' rocking-horses and with Glaucis</p><p>Lady Venus on the settee of the horsehair sea! </p><p><b>acatalectic </b>See <b>catalectic</b>. </p><p><b>acatalexis </b>The use of an acatalectic line.</p><p><b>accent </b>Emphasis on a syllable. Some prosodists distinguish between the terms "stress" and "accent" in order to clarify the different kinds of emphasis. These writers use "stress" when referring to metrical stress and reserve "accent" for the emphasis demanded by the language. Such emphasis is called <b>etymological, grammatical,</b> or more simply <b>word accent</b>. The emphasis that in normal speech falls on a heavily stressed syllable is the <b>primary accent (' ). </b>The emphasis that in normal speech falls on a lightly stressed syllable is the <b>secondary accent ( `). </b>Shelley's line "Ah, sister! Desolation is a delicate thing:" exhibits both primary and secondary accents in the word "de's o la tion." Usually, as here, a primary accent coincides with the metrical stress. An <b>even accent </b>or <b>level stress </b>is one which falls with equal emphasis on two syllables in a dissyllabic or polysyllabic word, as in man'kind' and wa'ter-worn' and sometimes occurs when two monosyllabic words are closely associated, such as old' man'. In verse it has the effect of DISTRIBUTED STRESS.

She had a play that was to be produced at the New York International Fringe Festival and a job waiting for her at the <i>New Yorker</i>. Tragically, five days after graduation, Marina died in a car crash.<br> <br>As her family, friends, and classmates, deep in grief, joined to create a memorial service for Marina, her unforgettable last essay for the <i>Yale Daily News</i>, &#x201c;The Opposite of Loneliness,&#x201d; went viral, receiving more than 1.4 million hits. She had struck a chord.<br> <br>Even though she was just twenty-two when she died, Marina left behind a rich, expansive trove of prose that, like her title essay, captures the hope, uncertainty, and possibility of her generation. <i>The Opposite of Loneliness</i> is an assem�blage of Marina&#x2019;s essays and stories that, like <i>The Last Lecture</i>, articulates the universal struggle that all of us face as we figure out what we aspire to be and how we can harness our talents to make an impact on the world.</p><p>J. R. Moehringer <p><b></b></p><b>About J. R. Moehringer</b><p></p> <p>J. R.

Author of the bestselling memoir, <i>The Tender Bar,</i> he is also the co-author of <i>Open</i> by Andre Agassi. His most recent publication is <i>Sutton</i>, published in 2012.</p> <br> <p><b></b></p><b>J. R. Moehringer on Marina Keegan</b><p></p> <p>I never met Marina Keegan, but when I learned of her death I felt as if I'd known her well. We belonged to several of the same tribes. We were both Yalies. We were both from the Northeast. Both Irish, both writers. We walked some of the same paths, probably sat in the same chairs. So it was as if I&#x2019;d lost a close cousin, or even a kid sister.</p><p> Then I read her work. In that terrible week, as media outlets posted her essays, as people around the world reposted them, I read every word with a sinking, quickening heart. The first news reports, I felt, had been wrong - this wasn&#x2019;t simply a promising young writer, this was a prodigy, a rare rare talent, still raw, still evolving, but shockingly mature. From the few things she&#x2019;d published in her brief life I could project a remarkable career, a line of words stretching far into the future, words that would have thrilled and enlightened, words that might have changed people&#x2019;s lives. As I grieved for her family, her friends, her boyfriend, I also grieved for the global community of readers who would never know the pleasure and excitement of a brand new book by Marina Keegan.</p> Marina Keegan <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p>All of which made me think there should be, there must be, at least one book with Marina&#x2019;s name on the spine. Publishers aren&#x2019;t eager to take chances these days, but I hoped that one would have the guts, the heart, to make a slim, posthumous collection of Marina&#x2019;s stories and essays and poems. I could actually see the book in my mind, stacked on the front table of a sunlit bookstore, perhaps the Yale bookstore, where I&#x2019;m sure Marina dreamed about her work appearing one day.</p> <p>A year later, it came in the mail, the very book I&#x2019;d seen in my mind, with the only possible title: <i>The Opposite of Loneliness</i>. I studied the striking cover photo and felt a wave of sorrow and joy. Then I sat down and read it and that sorrow-joy feeling became my constant companion over the next several days.</p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p>This is a book full of wonders. This is a book full of sentences that any writer, 21 or 101, would be proud to have authored. This is a book that will speak to young readers, because it expresses some of that inexpressible anxiety of starting out, of making life's first momentous choices, of wanting and fearing and needing and hoping and dreading everything at the same time. It will also speak to older readers, because it&#x2019;s an inspiring reminder of youth&#x2019;s brimming energy, its quivering sense of possibility.</p> <p>Young people get a bad rap for thinking they&#x2019;re immortal, and acting accordingly, but Marina dwelled on the end. Hers, civilization&#x2019;s, the sun&#x2019;s. &#x201c;And time, that takes survey of all the world, must have a stop.&#x201d; She must have heard her beloved adviser Harold Bloom expound many times on Hotspur&#x2019;s line, and clearly she took it to heart, personalized it. Savor every half-second, she seemed to be saying, to herself, to her readers, and her meditations on death, once charmingly precocious, now feel breathtakingly premonitory. Describing a group of fifty whales beached near her house on Cape Cod, she laments that their songs don&#x2019;t transmit on land, and thus they can&#x2019;t communicate their final thoughts. &#x201c;I imagined dying slowly next to my mother or a lover, helplessly unable to relay my parting message.&#x201d;</p> <p> Such was her fate. And yet it wasn't, not really. This book is her parting message, exquisitely relayed.</p> <p>And it&#x2019;s not a mournful message. There&#x2019;s so much light and humor here. In the title essay alone I hear glimmers of Lorrie Moore, Ann Beattie, Fran Lebowitz. For example, when Marina worries that other kids are sprinting ahead of her, embarking on fabulous careers while she&#x2019;s still clinging to the cocoon of Yale. &#x201c;Some of us have focused ourselves. Some of us know exactly what we want and are on the path to get it; already going to med school, working at the perfect NGO, doing research. To you I say both congratulations and you suck.&#x201d;</p> <p>My favorite passage might be this gorgeous burst of nostalgia, this prose poem about the bright college years. &#x201c;When the check is paid and you stay at the table. When it&#x2019;s four a.m. and no one goes to bed. That night with the guitar. That night we can&#x2019;t remember. That time we did, we went, we saw, we laughed, we felt. The hats.&#x201d;</p> <p>The hats. That tiny sentence was the first raindrop before the deluge, a tickling hint of all that was to come. How many 21-year-olds are capable of a line so sure-handed, so precisely and comically placed? The only other two-word sentence I can think of that had me laughing aloud and shaking my head was in Lolita. (Humbert summarizing his mother&#x2019;s demise: &#x201c;Picnic, lightning. &#x201d;)</p> <p> If I&#x2019;d met Marina, I&#x2019;d have urged her to keep these first hopeful essays handy, cherish their energy, refer to them whenever beset by despair and doubt. Instead I&#x2019;ll have to give that advice to her readers.</p> <p>I also might have told Marina that we do have a word for the opposite of loneliness. It&#x2019;s called reading. Again, I&#x2019;ll have to tell her readers. This book reminds us: as long as there are books, we&#x2019;re never completely alone. Open it anywhere and Marina&#x2019;s voice leaps off the page, uncommonly honest, forever present. With this lovely book always at hand, we and Marina will never be completely apart.</p>Marina Keegan (1989-2012) was an award-winning author, journalist, playwright, poet, actress, and activist.

Frank Lloyd Wright was an architect of vast and unprecedented vision, whose work is not only still admired by the critics and carefully studied by historians but is also widely beloved. Comfortable spaces, humanly scaled, with extraordinary attention to detail-as seen in a range of architectural forms-are at the center of Wright&#x2019;s enduring appeal. This vision and attention is nowhere more evident than in the drawings. It has been said that had Wright left us only drawings, and not his buildings as well, he would still be celebrated for his brilliant artistry, and this is borne out here. Even more significant, and shown here as never before, are the magical first moments of invention and inspiration-Wright&#x2019;s earliest sketches, some never before published-which offer unique insight into the mind of the master architect.<br><i>Frank Lloyd Wright Designs</i> is the most important and comprehensive book to be published on the drawings, designs, conceptual sketches, elevations, and plans of Wright, with particular emphasis on the development of certain important projects. It includes the best-known and beloved projects-like Fallingwater, The Coonley House, Midway Gardens, the Guggenheim, the Imperial Hotel-as well as a range of intriguing, unfamiliar, and previously unpublished drawings by Wright.</p><p><b>Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer</b> is director of archives at the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and has unprecedented access to its 300,000 correspondence documents and 22,000 drawings.

Her keen hindsight uncovers the humanity at the center of conflict with language that goes straight to the heart. This work stands as an elegy for the loss of innocence, an homage to the glimmer underneath the urban grunge, and a love song to the imperfections that unite and divide us.

Whether she is writing about men or women, the powerful or the powerless, the present day or the past, Laux observes, evokes and meditates with profound compassion and understanding for the delicate complexities of the human heart. Book of Men is a fabulous book that all men and women who turn to poetry for pleasure and knowledge will be reading with gratitude and admiration for many years to come.&nbsp;<br><br>-Alan Shapiro<br><br>The Book of Men is an utterly wonderful book, a collection of poems that only Dorianne Laux could write. She is at her very best here, each poem inhabited by a living voice, each poem artfully constructed to enter the reader like the gently pressed edge of a sharp and jagged object. One feels so many different things at once that the only response is a kind of rapture. To me, the book reads as a continuous whole, front to back, part of its supreme artistry being the musical composition of the placement and unerring modulation of the individual poems.

She's one of the poets who is keeping&nbsp;alive the brave art of <i>looking</i>, who insists on the humanizing fact of the mortal body.&nbsp; The Book of Men is a songbook- ruthless, damaged, and full of fierce athletic compassion.<br> -- Tony Hoagland</p><h2>Miramar</h2><p>This highly charged fable set in Alexandria, Egypt, in the late 1960s, centers on the&nbsp;guests of&nbsp;the Pension Miramar as they compete for the attention of the&nbsp;young servant Zohra.

This book will help the sailor analyze for himself the determinants of tactical success.<br><br> One of the foremost theoreticians of the art of yacht racing, Stuart H. Walker is also an outstanding practicing racer. For eight years Dr. Walker kept a complete record of the factors that determined the outcome of every race in which he competed. The recommendations he offers in <em>Advanced Racing Tactics</em> are based upon the analysis of these races&#x2015;the mistakes and the successes. He sets forth basic principles of starting, beating, reaching, and mark rounding that should be practiced every time, and he underlines what mattered, what consistently provided an advantage.<br><br> The advanced racing skipper, Dr. Walker writes, must look around, examine his own mistakes and successes, record them, review them, remember them. When he recognizes from this own experience the validity of the principles presented here, they will become useful to him. When he has incorporated them into his regular racing patterns, he will have made a five- or ten-year leap forward.</p><p>Stuart H. Walker is professor of pediatrics emeritus at the University of Maryland Medical School and an international dinghy champion. He was a member of the 1968 U.S. Olympic team and the 1979 U.S. Pan-American Team.</p><h2>American Hero: The Life and Death of Audie Murphy</h2><p>In a major new biography, veteran military historian and WII biographer, Charles Whiting combines both talents to tell the tale of barefoot Texan share-cropper&#39;s son, who could barely read and write, but became not only the US Army&#39;s most decorated soldier in its 250 - year history, but also the star of forty Paramount produced movies: most of which are shown on TV screens around the world to this very day. The gentle-eyed, baby-faced hero had won every decoration the United States had to offer before he was eligible to vote and killed 240 enemy soldiers in the process. Luck made him a movie star. Always he tried to improve himself, but time and time again he was relegated to the &#39;horse operas&#39;, where as he wisecracked cynically, &#34;it was the same old movie, only they changed the colour of the horse.&#34; But there was a price to pay for his heroism in drugs, nervous tension and Murphy&#39;s addiction to violence. Even as a middle-aged movie star, he always slept with a .45 beneath his pillow, plagued by nightmares of the war. Murphy had been an ordinary boy, who had volunteered to go to fight and did so with exceeding bravery in the last &#39;good war&#39;. He paid highly for that bravery and sense of duty to a country which had given him nothing save &#34;malnutrition&#34;, as he used to quip. He was that last American Hero, who did as President Kennedy proclaimed, &#34; Don&#39;t ask what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.&#34; Even before his young life had really commenced, he had become a legend. But in the end &#39;Tinseltown&#39; and the &#39;feather merchants&#39; of Hollywood broke him. As Time magazine commented on his death; &#34;Audie Murphy belonged to an earlier, simpler time, one in which bravery was a cardinal and killing was a virtue... We shall not see his like again.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Off Season</h2><p><p>Life is looking up for D.J. Schwenk. She&#x2019;s in eleventh grade, finally.

One of these was the strong views over the meaning and obligations of Constitutional government. The South held the traditional position of limited government and strict adherence to the protections of the Constitution, especially States Rights. The North favored a strong, centralized government and material and social programs unfettered by Constitutional limits. These issues are still very much alive.</p><p></p><h2>The Unlikely Adventures of the Shergill Sisters: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>The author of the Reese Witherspoon Book Club selection <em>Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows</em> follows her acclaimed America debut with this life-affirming, witty family drama&#x2014;an Indian <em>This Is Where I Leave You</em>&#x2014;about three Punjabi sisters embarking on a pilgrimage to their homeland to lay their mother to rest.</strong></p><p>The British-born Punjabi Shergill sisters&#x2014;Rajni, Jezmeen, and Shirina&#x2014;were never close and barely got along growing up, and now as adults, have grown even further apart.

The Girls of Murder City recounts two scandalous, sex-fueled murder cases and how an intrepid &#34;girl reporter&#34; named Maurine Watkins turned the beautiful, media-savvy suspects-&#34;Stylish Belva&#34; and &#34;Beautiful Beulah&#34;-into the talk of the town. Fueled by rich period detail and a cast of characters who seemed destined for the stage, The Girls of Murder City is a crackling tale that simultaneously presents the freewheeling spirit of the Jazz Age and its sober repercussions.</p><p>Chicago, 1924. There was nothing surprising about men turning up dead in the Second City. Life was cheaper than a quart of illicit gin in the gangland capital of the world. But two murders that spring were special---worthy of celebration. So believed Maurine Watkins, a wanna-be playwright and a girl reporter for the Chicago Tribune, the city&#39;s hanging paper. Newspaperwomen were supposed to write about clubs, cooking, and clothes, but the intrepid Miss Watkins, a minister&#39;s daughter from a small town, zeroed in on murderers instead. Looking for subjects to turn into a play, she would make Stylish Belva Gaertner and Beautiful Beulah Annan---both of whom had brazenly shot down their lovers---the talk of the town. Love-struck men sent flowers to the jail, and newly emancipated women sent impassioned letters to the newspapers. Soon more than a dozen women preened and strutted on Murderesses&#39; Row as they awaited trial, desperate for the same attention that was being lavished on Maurine Watkins&#39;s favorites.DOUGLAS PERRY is an award-winning writer and editor whose work has appeared in the <i>Chicago Tribune, The San Jose Mercury News, Details</i>, and <i>The Oregonian</i>.

Often from either very dysfunctional homes or, having spent a significant portion of our lives in a chemical-induced fog, it's no wonder that boundaries are either quite warped or simply non-existent when we finally clean up our acts and strive to live as productive members of society. <br><br> Sometimes this is easier said than done and we find that our relationships with those about us could really use some work. We either love too quickly and too much or put up walls and don't let anyone get close to us, fearing pain and rejection. These are all boundary issues and are a big part of emotional sobriety. Learning to set limits in recovery is a learned skill for many and it most certainly can be done. <br><br> <b>Boundaries in Recovery</b> was written to help you do just that. Written by someone who has been there and has had the same emotional sobriety struggles as most, this book takes a look at setting limitations from the perspective of the recovering person. Whether you need to learn to set healthy boundaries with family, partners, children, friends, or business associates, guidance is given to help the reader recognize and set healthy limits. If you learn to honor and respect yourself, and treat others with the same dignity you would want to be treated with, your whole life will change for the better. <br><br> Tags: boundaries, emotional sobriety, addiction and boundaries, alcoholism and boundaries, preventing relapse, living sober, recovery books, self-esteem, avoiding relapse, relationships and recovery, codependency, codependents</p><p></p><h2>Inverted World (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>The city is winched along tracks through a devastated land full of hostile tribes.

Along the way he meditates on the importance of good guides ("Really, the only thing a psychiatrist can do that a good guide can't is write prescriptions"), the challenge of salmon fishing ("Salmon prowl. If they're not here now, they could be here in half an hour. Or tomorrow. Or next month"), and the zen of fishing alone ("I also enjoy where my mind goes when I'm fishing alone, which is usually nowhere in particular and by a predictable route"). On a more serious note, he ponders the damaging effects of disasters both natural and man-made: drought, wildfires, and the politics of dam-building, among others. <br> <br> Reflecting on a trip to a small creek near his home, Gierach writes, "In my brightest moments, I think slowing down...has opened huge new vistas on my old home water. It's like a friendship that not only lasts, but gets better against the odds." Similarly, <i>Still Life with Brook Trout</i> proves that Gierach, like fly-fishing itself, becomes deeper and richer with time.</p><p>Over the course of 14 books, John Gierach has become the fishing buddy to countless anglers he's never met. Waterlogged and dog-eared and thrown in the back of pickup trucks, Gierach's classics <i>Trout Bum</i> and <i>The View from Rat Lake</i> gave voice to the inner wanderings and wonderings of fly fishers the world over. In <i>Still Life with Brook Trout</i> Gierach continues his enviable jaunts--he seems constantly to be traipsing off to some undiscovered creek, private water, or middle-of-nowhere secret spot--but this time, there's a difference. More than ever, Gierach is forced to deal with an aging body that can't quite scramble over logjams, bushwhack through the brush, or wade quite as deeply as before. Running parallel with these observations, Gierach ponders the effects of a three-year drought in the mountain West. But whether it is his aching knees or dropping levels in reservoirs, rivers, and streams, Gierach always retains hope without dismissing the often grim odds, ridiculous situations, and glum prospects so familiar to anglers. And while Gierach nurses his hope like an ember, he never abandons his appreciation for the sport's absurdity, humor, and humbling moments. He has become the master of the literary shrug, as if to say, "What can you do? Might as well go fishing." Like the best of Gierach's work, <i>Still Life with Brook Trout</i> mirrors the exquisitely languid pace of the sport. He meanders, explores side roads and bends in the river, and never fails to take note of "a deer crossing a meadow or a circling hawk ... even if it means missing a strike when it finally comes." Gierach is on his game here, and longtime fans will rise to this offering hook, line, and sinker. <i>--Steve Duda</i>John Gierach is the author of&nbsp;more than twenty books about fly-fishing. His writing has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Field &amp; Stream, Gray&#x2019;s Sporting Journal</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel</i>, where he is a regular columnist.

A friendship with God.</p><p>Neale Donald Walsch grew up fearing God, especially after his mother, a neighborhood mystic, was caught reading cards for a friend. His mother was "trafficking with the devil," according to Walsch's deeply religious aunt, and as a result, "God will send her straight to hell."<p> That was the start of a relationship born of "fearship," as Walsch calls it. In <i>Friendship with God</i>, Walsh speaks to the struggles he's had learning to see God as a true friend rather than a punishing judge. Like his immensely popular <i>Conversations with God</i> series, <i>Friendship with God</i> is written mostly in dialogue format, modeling how anyone can converse with God. What makes the book especially accessible is Walsh's humble voice that gently addresses most people's confusion and doubts. For example, Walsh talks about feeling squeamish that God knows the shameful secrets of his life. In response, God points out that Walsh has shared his dark secrets with friends and lovers. So why not share these truths with God, who has never judged or punished him, and never will? These types of tender and reassuring conversations give readers the courage to begin their own private dialogues with the divine. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>The first book in a new series by the multimillion-copy bestselling author of <i>Conversations with God</i>.<br><br>Neale Donald Walsch has changed the way millions of Americans think about God.

Otherwise I will plunge to my death. &#39;Please God, take this away,&#39; I pray when I can.&#34; For Gillian, &#34;dealing with depression&#34; means learning to accept and treat it as a physical illness. In these pages she describes her journey through various therapies and medications to find a way to live with depression. She faces down the guilt of a wife and mother of four, two with special needs. How can she care for her family when she can&#39;t even get out of bed? Her story is real and raw, not one of quick fixes. But hope remains as she discovers that living with depression is still life.</p><p>Gillian Marchenko is an author, speaker, wife, mother and advocate for individuals with special needs. Gillian's first book was <em>Sun Shines Down</em>, and she has written for publications such as <em>Chicago Parent</em>, <em>Thriving Family</em> and <em>Today's Christian Woman</em>. She and her husband, Sergei, spent four years as church planters with the Evangelical Free Church of America in Kiev, Ukraine, and they now live with their four daughters in St. Louis, Missouri."A valuable memoir of depression for those both inside and outside its grasp." (Library Journal, July 2016)<br><br>"Such painfully beautiful writing. . . . I'm so very grateful you are here. I have deep respect for the courage and bravery it takes to keep choosing life." (Kay Warren)<br><br>"Her story is real and raw, not one of quick fixes. But hope remains as she discovers that living with depression is still life." (The Light, May 2016)<br><br>"Over the years I've learned much from Gillian Marchenko about what it's like to live and parent through clinical depression. I'm so glad others will now be able to learn from her in her newest memoir, <em>Still Life</em>. With her signature honesty and real-life faith, Gillian reminds us that God meets us in the hard, often debilitating places. For those who suffer from depression or those who love others that do, this book is a treasured story that articulates life and faith in the midst of this disease. You won't be sorry you've read it." (Alexandra Kuykendall, author of Loving My Actual Life and The Artist's Daughter)<br><br>"In this intimate memoir, Gillian Marchenko exposes her deepest, most painful struggles with humor and grace. More than a story of acceptance, compassion and hope; this book is a celebration of life." (Kelley Clink, author of A Different Kind of Same)<br><br>"With unflinching honesty, Gillian Marchenko holds up a mirror to her own clinical depression and in doing so gives language and definition to something that often feels vague and dark. A must-read for anyone trying to understand their depressed spouse, friend, family member . . . or self." (Addie Zierman, author of When We Were on Fire and Night Driving)<br><br>"<em>Still Life</em> is a remarkably authentic story of perseverance and faithfulness. Gillian Marchenko's candor in sharing her experience with depression will be of great comfort to many who have bought into the falsehood that their suffering has resulted from a lack of faith. Gillian demonstrates how it is possible to faithfully fulfill God's purpose in life while experiencing the effects of a chronic illness that made getting out of bed a nearly insurmountable challenge on all too many days. Her authenticity in sharing her experiences offers encouragement and true hope to many who identify with her story." (Stephen Grcevich, founder and director of strategic initiatives, Key Ministry)<br><br>"Gillian Marchenko generously lets us know her and walk her journey, and in the process we grow to love her. You won't find pat answers or bland reassurances here; you'll find a real and courageous woman, a serious fight with mental illness and faith-fueled hope. If you live with depression or care about someone who does, you must read this book." (Amy Simpson, author of Troubled Minds and Anxious)<br><br>"If you've never struggled with depression but want to know what it's like, <em>Still Life</em> paints an accurate picture. If you have lived on that fearful ledge called depression, you'll find an ally in Gillian Marchenko. With heartfelt honesty, Marchenko describes life with double depression (Major Depressive Disorder and Dysthymia). In my dozen years as a licensed professional counselor, I've never read a more accurate book about depression and the toll it takes on the one who suffers, as well the impact on those closest to the sufferer. This book holds no cure, no magic wand, but it does extend hope." (Lucille Zimmerman, LPC, author of Renewed: Finding Your Inner Happy in an Overwhelmed World)<br><br>"Life with depression is still life, which means beauty and dignity are still found even when not felt. Life with depression is also a <em>still life</em>, a straightforward painting depicting commonplace objects, something that causes us to stop, look and listen, and if we do, to possibly realize that this ordinary object is infused with the beauty of God. Marchenko's book has been a still life for me, allowing me to stop and study the intricacies of a life with depression, and in doing so, to begin to see my own areas of darkness as places capable of framing a masterpiece."

Centuries after our nation was founded on genocide, settler colonialism, and slavery, many Americans are kinda-sorta-maybe waking up to the reality that our racial politics are (still) garbage. But in the midst of this reckoning, widespread denial and misunderstandings about race persist, even as white supremacy and racial injustice are more visible than ever before.<br><br>Combining no-holds-barred social critique, humorous personal anecdotes, and analysis of the latest interdisciplinary scholarship on systemic racism, sociologist Crystal M.

In 2003, while surfing, she lost her left arm to a 14-foot tiger shark. With resilience and tenacity, Bethany returned to the water a month later, and within two years won her first national title. Her unbelievably positive attitude fascinated the world, resulting in an autobiography that was later adapted into the film&nbsp;<em>Soul Surfer. </em>Her courage and talent led to her induction into the Surfer&#x2019;s Hall of Fame in 2017.

Right from the start, Hamilton makes her religious background clear, but even though one whole chapter is devoted to faith, the overall focus is on inspiring her audience, not on preaching religious views (she even states, "No matter how much I want others to make improvements to their lifestyles, I can't push them to make a change"). Tween and teen girls will enjoy the writing, which makes readers feel as though they're having a one-on-one conversation with the author. Each chapter has tips and tricks on how to stay on task, as well as a Q&amp;A session with Hamilton. The chapters on exercise and healthy eating are supported by a certified athletic trainer and a nutritionist and are easy to follow, and the step-by-step pictures of each workout make them accessible. The recipe and healthy eating chapters emphasize Hamilton's own food pyramid and her concept of a "clean green" diet, and the advice she gives will apply to most readers. This title will inspire girls to gain self-confidence and make better choices in their own lives.&#x2014;Joanne Albano, Commack Public Library, NY</p><h2>Distributed Blackness: African American Cybercultures (Critical Cultural Communication, 9)</h2><p><p><b>An explanation of the digital practices of the black Internet </b></p><p>From BlackPlanet to #BlackGirlMagic, Distributed Blackness places blackness at the very center of internet culture. Andr� Brock Jr. claims issues of race and ethnicity as inextricable from and formative of contemporary digital culture in the United States. Distributed Blackness analyzes a host of platforms and practices (from Black Twitter to Instagram, YouTube, and app development) to trace how digital media have reconfigured the meanings and performances of African American identity. Brock moves beyond widely circulated deficit models of respectability, bringing together discourse analysis with a close reading of technological interfaces to develop nuanced arguments about how &#x201c;blackness&#x201d; gets worked out in various technological domains. </p><p>As Brock demonstrates, there&#x2019;s nothing niche or subcultural about expressions of blackness on social media: internet use and practice now set the terms for what constitutes normative participation. Drawing on critical race theory, linguistics, rhetoric, information studies, and science and technology studies, Brock tabs between black-dominated technologies, websites, and social media to build a set of black beliefs about technology. In explaining black relationships with and alongside technology, Brock centers the unique joy and sense of community in being black online now.</p></p><p><b>Andr� Brock, Jr.</b> is Associate Professor of Black Digital Studies at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p><h2>Threshold - Volume 1: The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny</h2><p>The first in a six-volume series, Volume 1: Threshold contains all of Zelazny&#39;s short works from his early years through the mid 1960s--a period of experimentation and growth that flowered into gems such as &#34;A Rose for Ecclesiastes,&#34; &#34;The Graveyard Heart,&#34; &#34;The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth,&#34; and &#34;He Who Shapes.&#34; The stories in this series are enriched by editors&#39; notes and Zelazny&#39;s own words, taken from his many essays, describing why he wrote the stories and what he thought about them in retrospect.</p><p>Threshold: The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, v.1. By Roger Zelazny. Ed. by David G. Grubbs and others. Apr. 2009. 576p. NESFA, $29 (9781886778719).<br><br>After introductory essays from Robert Silverberg and Zelazny's childhood friend Carl Yoke, the range of Zelazny's stories unfolds, from early work first published in a high-school literary magazine to the masterpiece, "A Rose for Ecclesiastes." Everything fascinates, especially for die-hard Zelazny fans, not least because his growth as a storyteller is so apparent between "Youth Eternal" (one of the high-school pieces) and the novella "He Who Shapes," published 10 years later in the standard-setting sf magazine Amazing. The range of Zelazny's literary background becomes evident in the notes accompanying each story, with their citation of influences from Saint-Exupéry to mystical religion. Sf history isn't the main interest here, though, for many of these stories have aged shockingly well. "Circe Has Her Problems" is a space-traveling take on the Homeric sorceress. "Nine Starships Waiting" strangely remains Cyril Tourneur's Jacobean Revenger's Tragedy (the subject of Zelazny's MA thesis). "The Graveyard Heart" tackles immortality among the party set, and in "The Stainless Steel Leech," even robots have their vampires. Poetry is scattered throughout, and some unfinished fragments fill out the volume. Zelazny (1937--95) remains fascinating, not least because the way he tells stories makes them unique. -- Regina Schroeder --American Library Association</p><h2>Sword Song (Sunburst Book)</h2><p><p>Discovered among Rosemary Sutcliff 's papers after her death in 1992, Sword Song is the swashbuckling epic of a young Viking swordsman, banished from his home for unintentionally killing a man, who takes up a new life as a mercenary.</p></p><p><p><b>Rosemary Sutcliff</b> (1920-1992) wrote dozens of novels for young readers, including the award-winning trilogy set in Roman Britain,<i> The Eagle of the Ninth, The Silver Branch, </i>and <i>The Lantern Bearers</i>. Shortly before her death, she was awarded the CBE, one of Britain's most prestigious honors.</p>Grade 7 Up-Exiled from his home for five years, 16-year-old Bjarni Sigurdson is forced to support himself by becoming a mercenary. Although he is young and untried, he sells his sword service first to Onund Treefoot and later to Thorstein the Red, Norse chieftains who have settled in the islands west of Scotland. With his black dog Hugin in tow, the young man learns the ways of the sea and of warfare as he follows these men in battle and in peace. After five years, he decides to return home, but is cast ashore during a violent storm for one final adventure. The action-filled plot develops coherently and is less episodic than those of many journey tales. Bjarni is an appealing, well-rounded character whose growth and development keep the story focused. His early experiences are those of an adolescent, as he chases after Onund's enemies. Thorstein is involved in more serious matters, making treaties and establishing settlements, and Bjarni, too, becomes more reflective, considering his behavior and his future plans. Sutcliff wrote historical fiction as if she lived it, and this book is no exception. Particularly interesting is her portrayal of the coexistence of the old religion of the Norsemen and that of the White Christ. Although the author did not complete the final draft before her death, this is a well-crafted story that will appeal to sophisticated readers. In places the language is slightly less polished than usual, and Bjarni's final adventure is not as well integrated into the plot as the earlier ones, but still, this is vintage Sutcliff.<br><i>Barbara Scotto, Michael Driscoll School, Brookline, MA</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Carter Family Collection</h2><p>(Guitar Recorded Versions).

He was a death sentence to rustlers and the devil incarnate to homesteaders in late nineteenth-century Wyoming.<br><br>Did Tom Horn commit the 1901 murder of the fourteen-year-old son of a sheep-owning homesteader who had stolen from the cattle barons ranges? If not, who did?<br><br>Cheyenne author Chip Carlson, in this, his third book, answers these questions and others with the monumental results of more than ten years of research into primary sources.<br><br>Who were Tom Horn s other victims? Was there collusion on the part of three governors in two Colorado murders? How could the jury return a verdict of guilty in Tom Horn s trial in the face of evidence that someone else was the killer? Why did Tom Horn s parents flee to Canada? Was there jury tampering and bribery? Why did Tom Horn say I would kill him and be done with him? What was the role of schoolteacher Glendolene Kimmell, and where did she end her years?<br><br>Tom Horn, the most notorious of Wyoming s range detectives and a pre-eminent name in Wyoming history, operated unchecked until he was arrested for the murder of Willie Nickell. The murder and questionable nature of Horn s conviction still ignite firestorms of controversy in Wyoming.<br><br>Before he was hanged Horn said, I have lived about fifteen ordinary lives. I would like to have had somebody who saw my past and could picture it to the public. It would be the most god damn interesting reading in the country. Now author Chip Carlson provides that reading.</p><p>&#34;...with this latest work he [Chip Carlson] must be considered the authority on Tom Horn. This work is a definite must for those interested in outlaws and lawmen as well as for those who love a mystery. The question of Horn&#39;s guilt or innocence can still be the reason for arguments in Wyoming today.&#34; --Chuck Parsons, National Association for Outlaw and Lawman History, Inc.</p><h2>Witchling (Sisters of the Moon, Book 1)</h2><p>We&#x2019;re the D&#x2019;Artigo sisters: Half-human, half-Faerie, we&#x2019;re savvy&#x2014;and sexy&#x2014;operatives for the Otherworld Intelligence Agency.&nbsp; But our mixed-blood heritage short-circuits our talents at all the wrong times.&nbsp; My sister Delilah shapeshifts into a tabby cat whenever she&#x2019;s stressed.&nbsp; Menolly&#x2019;s a vampire who&#x2019;s still trying to get the hang of being undead.&nbsp; And me?&nbsp; I&#x2019;m Camille&#x2014;a wicked-good witch.&nbsp; Except my magic&#x2019;s as unpredictable as the weather, as my enemies are about to find out the hard way...<p>At the Wayfarer Inn, a portal to Otherworld and the local hangout for humans and beasties alike, a fellow operative, Jocko, has been murdered.&nbsp; Every clue points to Shadow Wing, the soul-munching, badass leader of the Subterranean Realms.&nbsp; He&#x2019;s made it clear that he aims to raze humankind to the ground, turning both Earth and Otherworld into his private playground.&nbsp; Our assignment:&nbsp; Keep Shadow Wing and his minions from creeping into Earth via the Wayfarer.&nbsp; The demons figure they&#x2019;re in like Flynn.&nbsp; After all, with only my bumbling sisters and me standing in the way, how can they miss?&nbsp; But we&#x2019;ve got a secret for them:&nbsp; Faulty wiring or not, nobody kicks ass like the D&#x2019;Artigo girls...<br></p></p><p>New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Yasmine Galenorn writes urban fantasy for Berkley: both the bestselling Otherworld/Sisters of the Moon Series for Berkley and the bestselling Indigo Court urban fantasy series. In the past, she wrote mysteries for Berkley Prime Crime, and nonfiction metaphysical books. Her books have hit the New York Times and USA Today bestseller lists numerous times. Yasmine has been in the Craft for over 30 years, is a shamanic witch, and describes her life as a blend of teacups and tattoos. She lives in Kirkland WA with her husband Samwise and their cats.The first in an engrossing new series about conflict in the magic modern world&#x2014;as told by the half-human, half-Faerie D'Artigo sisters&#x2014;the latest from Galenorn (<i>One Hex of a Wedding</i>) is a whimsical reminder of fantasy's importance in everyday life. Narrator Camille is a good witch with unpredictable powers who runs a Seattle bookstore while working as an Otherworld Intelligence operative, sent Earthside to keep an eye on things. When an operative from the Wayfaerer, a human/Faerie hangout, is killed, Camille springs into action with her sisters Delilah, a werecat, and Menolly, a freshly minted vampire. Tracing the murder back to evil demon leader Shadow Wing, the sisters find evidence of a far-reaching plot, but the Otherworld Intelligence Agency offers no help, stifled by bureaucratic red tape and a nasty Otherworld battle. Galenorn's gallery of rogues is an imaginative delight, each species and personality carefully crafted. Though the plot can drag, effusive characters and pretty writing ("I whispered, and the stars heard me from behind their cloud cover and answered") will lead readers through to the much-anticipated final battle. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Oliver Heaviside (1850 -1925) may not be a household name but he was one of the great pioneers of electrical science: his work led to huge advances in communications and became the bedrock of the subject of electrical engineering as it is taught and practiced today. His ideas and original accomplishments are now so much a part of everyday electrical science that they are simply taken for granted; almost nobody wonders how they came about and Heaviside&#39;s name has been lost from view.This book tells the complete story of this extraordinary though often unappreciated scientist. The author interweaves details of Heaviside&#39;s life and personality with clear explanations of his many important contributions to the field of electrical engineering. He describes a man with an irreverent sense of fun who cared nothing for social or mathematical conventions and lived a fiercely independent life. His achievements include creating the mathematical tools that were to prove essential to the proper understanding and use of electricity, finding a way to rid telephone lines of the distortion that had stifled progress, and showing that electrical power doesn&#39;t flow in a wire but in the space alongside it. At first his ideas were thought to be weird, even outrageous, and he had to battle long and hard to get them accepted. Yet by the end of his life he was awarded the first Faraday Medal. This engrossing story will restore long-overdue recognition to a scientist whose achievements in many ways were as crucial to our modern age as those of Edison&#39;s and Tesla&#39;s.</p><p><b>Basil Mahon</b> is the author of <i>The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell</i>.

His achievements include reverse engineering and reframing Maxwell&#x2019;s equations to make them more accessible, thereby setting the stage for much of twentieth-century physics and engineering. Along the way, he also developed vector analysis and operational calculus to encode and manipulate what he envisioned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although virtually unknown today, Heaviside&#x2019;s impact on our world has been enormous. Basil Mahon&#x2019;s book provides keen insights into this dramatic saga.

The patent clerk Albert Einstein did so, and so did the now almost forgotten Oliver Heaviside. Basil Mahon has written a most perceptive account of Heaviside&#x2019;s life in middle-class Victorian England and how Heaviside, a curious youth with little education and few prospects, in time came to be on collegial terms with the great physicists of the time&#x2014;Maxwell, Thomson, Fitzgerald, and Hertz, to name a few&#x2014;who recognized the genius of this peculiar eccentric. Along the way, we learn about the heroic early years of underwater telegraphy and telephony, the era&#x2019;s communication revolutions, and how early, flawed views on electricity gradually gave way to Maxwell&#x2019;s brilliant insight and to his famous equations of electromagnetism&#x2014;which Heaviside cast into the lucid format in which physicists now know them.

The quilters of Gandiegow expand more than their quilting enterprise into the village of Whussendale. They bring along a heavy dose of good-hearted meddling, too. What&#x2019;s the outcome? Love will never be the same... When Tuck MacBride, Gandiegow&#x2019;s favorite scapegoat, is blamed for a fisherman&#x2019;s tragic accident, Tuck takes on extra work to secretly funnel his earnings to the maimed fisherman&#x2019;s family. Haunted by the mistaken turn of events, Tuck is working night and day. Even so he can&#x2019;t stop thinking about the new lass who has just arrived in town. Ryn Breckenridge has no one left in the world. To fulfill her mother&#x2019;s last request, Ryn travels to Scotland to return a quilt to her long lost cousin. Hoping to rebuild family ties, Ryn volunteers to help her cousin at the upcoming quilt retreat. But there is more than quilting on Ryn&#x2019;s mind. The irresistible Tuck MacBride is proving to be a dangerous distraction. Ryn&#x2019;s past is riddled with bad boys like Tuck, who have left her alone and broken. She vows to stay away, but can&#x2019;t help taking a closer look when she realizes there is more to Tuck than meets the eye. Both of their pasts contain shattered promises, but Scotland is known to bring reluctant hearts together. Will the two of them be willing to cross the deep chasm between them and find love? If they do, they will only have Scotland to blame...</p><p>Award-winning author Patience Griffin has been writing and sewing her whole life but didn&#x2019;t discover her love of quilting until her late thirties. She decided the best way to acquire her first quilt was to make one for herself. At nearly the same time, she started commuting three and half hours a day for her dream engineering job. To pass the time on the long drive, she got hooked on audiobooks&#x2014;especially books with love stories. Within a couple of years, she was writing stories of her own. It was no surprise to her family and friends when she combined her love of quilting, her small-town roots, and her obsession with Scotland into novels. She has gained some recognition with her September 11th Story Quilt which has toured the country as the property of the Pentagon. She has a master's degree in nuclear engineering but spends her days writing stories about hearth and home, and dreaming about the fictional small towns of Gandiegow and Whussendale, Scotland.<p>Praise for the Kilts and Quilts novels<br> "Griffin's lyrical and moving debut marks her as a most talented newcomer to the romance genre."</p><p>-<em>Publishers Weekly</em> starred review</p><p> </p><p>"A fun hop to scenic Scotland for the price of a paperback."</p><p> -<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p><p> </p><p>"Start this heartwarming, romance series!"</p><p> -Woman's World magazine</p><p> </p><p>"With the backdrop of a beautiful town in Scotland, Griffin's story is charming and heartwarming.

Other messes are easy to attribute to various visitors. A bear left hair on the lawn chair, a chipmunk scattered shells on the counter, and a beaver sprayed wood chips from the bedpost all over the guest room after a midnight snack. The moose prints remain a mystery until the final spread reveals who the culprit is. Wilson's rhyming text will keep youngsters laughing at the animal friends and their antics. Davis's goggle-eyed cartoon style adds fun to the tale, highlighting the house's eclectic appearance, cozy untidiness, and the noise and energy of its inhabitants. The creatures are packed with personality: a ram wears tortoiseshell glasses and a polka-dot bow tie, a goose with a pearl necklace delicately sips tea, and a smiling mouse maid scurries around trying to keep up with the clutter. An enjoyable choice for storytime, this book will hold children's interest right up to the amusing-and appropriately predictable-ending.<i>-Susan E.

First published in 1904, Skene did several revisions, the last of which was published in 1938 and reprinted here in its original form. In 1962, the book was completely revised by Francis S. Kinney and re-published as Skene's Elements of Yacht Design. Kinney's last version was in 1973 and it is long out of print.<br><br>While the experts are divided on the relative merits of the different editions, it appears that there is strong demand for Skene's original work. At last the book is again available to the many boatbuilders. aspiring naval architects and sailors who need it for frequent reference. The index has been completely revised and expanded to make it more useful for today's readers.<br><br>"This book is intended to be a practical and concise presentation of some of the operations involved in designing yachts of all types. Cumbersome and impractical methods which are so often found in more pretentious works on naval architecture have been avoided. Those presented have been in everyday use by the author." Thus wrote Norman L. Skene int he preface to the fifth edition of Elements of Yacht Design.</p><p>Norman L. Skene was one of America&#39;s foremost yacht designers. This book is his legacy.A little gem, first published in 1904 which, in these days of standard hulls, fills a much felt gap in our knowledge. We know so little about hull lines that it is really valuable to have at hand what is a standard work of reference. There are bits that no longer apply but the principles of hull design and what keeps a yacht going in heavy weather and light are intensely satisfying; the more so as we no longer for the most part commission an architect to design a yacht and watch its construction.<br>An absorbing and classic work, well worth the effort to assimilate. (<i>Cruising</i>)<br><br>Skene runs through many of the formulas used in yacht design, and their underlying principles. For the non-mathematician, it makes one realize how far off the mark most of our boats are. Buy this book and put your own boat s measurements into the formula.

This one is different. In a real game, a player may sometimes need to find a combination. On the other hand he may have to reject a tactical idea and simply find a good positional move. His task is to find the right move, whatever it may be. The 300 puzzles in this book put you precisely in that situation. Spectacular ideas abound in these positions, but it is for you to decide whether to go in for them, or whether you would be falling into a trap. If you need them, there are hints to help you on your way. The book ends with a series of tests to measure your skills against those of other players.<br> <br>For this new edition, John Nunn, a top-class grandmaster and a solving world champion, has added 50 new puzzles (with hints and detailed solutions) to test your skills to the full.

Life is difficult. You don&#x2019;t know the secret.</b> <br><br>Whether readers are devout believers or distant seekers, <i>The Idolatry of God </i>shows that we must lay down our certainties and honestly admit our doubts to identify with Jesus. Rollins purposely upsets fundamentalist certainty in order to open readers up to a more loving, active manifestation of Christ&#x2019;s love. <br><br>In contrast to the usual understanding of the &#x201c;Good News&#x201d; as a message offering satisfaction and certainty, Rollins argues for a radical and shattering alternative. He explores how the Good News actually involves embracing the idea that we can&#x2019;t be whole, that life is difficult, and that we are in the dark. Showing how God has traditionally been approached as a product that will render us complete, remove our suffering, and reveal the answers, he introduces an incendiary approach to faith that invites us to joyfully embrace our brokenness, resolutely face our unknowing, and courageously accept the difficulties of existence. Only then, he argues, can we truly rob death of its sting and enter into the fullness of life.</p><p>Peter Rollins is a widely sought after writer, lecturer, storyteller, and public speaker. He is the founder of Ikon, a Belfast, Northern Ireland, faith group that has gained an international reputation for blending live music, visual imagery, soundscapes, theater, ritual, and reflection. He currently resides in Greenwich, Connecticut.CHAPTER 1<br> <br>The Church Shouldn&#x2019;t Do Worship Music, the Charts Have It Covered<br> <br><i>Creatio ex Nihilo</i><br> <br>Whether we look at our own personal history or reflect upon the history of civilization, it is difficult to avoid the sense that we feel a lack in the very depths of our being, a lack that we try to cover over with any number of religious, political, and cultural remedies. This feeling might touch us like a breeze or knock us over with the force of a hurricane, but however it comes, most of us can testify to the feeling that there is something just beyond our reach that might help to fill this void, whether it is a person, money, power, possessions, God, or heaven.<br> <br>It is natural for us to think that our present discontent arises as a result of something we currently do not have. We imagine there might be a way of abolishing the feeling if only we had the money, fame, job, or health that currently evades us. But people from all walks of life seem to experience the same kind of dissatisfaction that we do, even when they have the very things we believe would make our lives whole. And on the occasions when we gain the thing we believe will make us happy, we find that the satisfaction we experience is at best partial and at worst utterly unfulfilling.<br> <br>In order to approach the root cause of this dissatisfaction and work out why it seems so difficult to abolish, let us begin by reviving an obscure and seemingly absurd Latin phrase that refers to the idea of something coming from nothing: <i>creatio ex nihilo</i>.<br><br>How can absence or lack be a generative and creative force in the world?<br><br>Upon first being confronted by this idea it might seem like nonsense, for how can nothing give rise to something? How can absence or lack be a generative and creative force in the world?<br> <br>Yet the idea of nothing bringing about something is not as strange as it might sound. Take the following example:<br> <br>There was once a young woman who, late one evening, was taking a shower when the doorbell rang. Knowing that her husband was dozing in the upstairs bedroom she quickly wrapped herself in a towel and ran to the door. When she opened it, she was greeted by her next-door neighbor Joe.<br> <br>Upon seeing her wearing nothing but a towel Joe pulled four hundred dollars from his back pocket, looked her in the eye, and said, &#x201c;I have always been attracted to you. What do you say to the following indecent proposal? If I were to offer you this four hundred dollars right now, would you drop the towel for me?&#x201d;<br> <br>After a moment&#x2019;s reflection, she reluctantly agreed, dropped the towel, and let him look at her naked body. True to his word, Joe gave her the money and left.<br> <br>Picking up the towel she hid the money and then went up to the bedroom. As she entered the room, her husband woke up and asked, &#x201c;Did the doorbell ring a few minutes ago?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; replied the woman. &#x201c;It was just Joe from next door.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Great! Did he give you the four hundred dollars he owes me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Here we witness a type of <i>creatio ex nihilo</i> at work, for the neighbor Joe has nothing to offer except the illusion of something (four hundred dollars that is not his), but this illusion generates a desired effect&#x2014;the woman exposing her body. Nothing was made to look like something and created a result.<br> <br>So how can this idea of nothing creating something help us understand the dissatisfaction that seems so much a part of human life?<br> <br>We Enter the World with Nothing<br> <br>Infants undergo two births. The first is also the most plain to see&#x2014;their physical entry into the world. The second, however, is less obvious; it is the birth of their self-consciousness. These two events occur close together, but they are not simultaneous, for their tiny bodies have already come onto the scene before they develop any real sense of being an individual. In this way their physical bodies are a type of womb out of which their selfhood arises.<br><br>Infants undergo two births.<br><br>This important point in human development was named &#x201c;the mirror phase&#x201d; by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and is generally estimated to start between the ages of six to eighteen months. While the process is gradual, it is around this time that the infant begins to identify as existing in separation from her surroundings and slowly begins to experience herself as an individual.<br> <br>The time before this awakening can be described as a type of prehistory, for it is the time before language, before self-consciousness, before the sense of &#x201c;I.&#x201d; It is only as the infant begins to enter selfhood that her history really begins, a history that cannot articulate what came before it, yet which remains indelibly marked by it.<br> <br>One of the fundamental experiences that arises from this second birth is a profound and disturbing sense of loss, for as soon as we experience our inner world, we encounter for the first time an outer world. As we develop a sense of our internal space, we are confronted with another one, a space existing beyond the borders of our flesh. Before the formation of our inner world, there is no sense of &#x201c;me&#x201d; and thus no notion of &#x201c;you.&#x201d; There is no near and no far; no inside and, therefore, no outside; no barriers that would separate me from everything beyond the threshold of my skin. Before the advent of selfhood, the infant&#x2019;s body exists in a type of equilibrium with the environment, being impacted by it but not standing in contrast to it.<br> <br>All this changes as the child gains a sense of selfhood, for at this point, the world is experienced as &#x201c;out there.&#x201d; With the advent of the &#x201c;I,&#x201d; there is an experience of that which is &#x201c;not I.&#x201d; The sense of selfhood is marked indelibly with the sense of separation.<br> <br>This means that one of our most basic and primal experiences of the world involves a sense of loss, for when we feel separated from something we assume that there was something we once had. The interesting thing to note, however, is that this sense of loss is actually an illusion, for we never actually lost anything. Why? Because there was no &#x201c;me&#x201d; before this experience of separation. Before the experience of loss there was no self to have enjoyed the union that we sense has been ripped away from us. The very birth of our subjectivity then signals a sense of losing something that we never had in the first place.<br> <br>This primordial experience of separation means nothing less than the experience of a gap, a feeling that there is some gulf between us and that which we have &#x201c;lost.&#x201d; In light of this we can read the scriptural saying &#x201c;For we brought nothing into the world&#x201d; quite literally, as meaning that we enter the world with one thing in our possession: nothingness itself (i.e., a sense of some space separating us from the world we inhabit).<br> <br><i>Horror Vacui</i><br> <br>It is this sense of a gap that causes us to feel incomplete in some way. As a result, one of our first impulses is to find ways of abolishing the void. We attempt this by connecting our vague and abstract sense of separation to something concrete and then trying to gain it. Just as someone might manage what would otherwise be a crippling anxiety by coupling it with something particular (creating, for example, a fear of spiders), so we take our general sense of separation and connect it with an actual object that we might be able to gain. However, this strategy can never wholly work, as the disquieting sense of separation that makes its presence felt in our bodies has a hunger bigger than any object or objects could ever satisfy.<br> <br>As we grow, the things we feed to this insatiable hunger change. As children we may think that a certain friendship, toy, or adventure will satisfy us, while as adults we might believe that a certain partner will fill the gap, or perhaps a job, a spiritual entity, a child, a political goal, or reaching a certain level of fame. The things that we believe will rid us of this gap differ and change over time, but the belief that something will fill the void remains constant.<br><br>The very thing we say we hate in the other is often the very thing we desire most of all.<br><br>Of course most of us will scoff at the idea there is something that will render us whole and will satisfy our seemingly insatiable desire. But what we deny with our lips is often found in the very texture of our lives. For instance, someone&#x2019;s hatred of the wealthy and famous is often little more than a sublimated form of jealousy. The very thing we say we hate in the other is often the very thing we desire most of all. Perhaps we feel unable to achieve such wealth, or we have been taught that it is morally wrong to do so. As such we have to turn our desire into a form of hatred, a hatred that masks what we really want. For instance, it is not uncommon to find small churches that speak disparagingly about larger communities, claiming that small is better. While this may sometimes reflect their true beliefs on the subject, one wonders if some of these churches would feel the same way if they began to grow significantly.<br> <br>This mechanism is something we can see played out every day in school playgrounds across the world. Witness a little boy pulling the hair of a girl in his class&#x2014;the only person who doesn&#x2019;t know that he really likes the girl is often the boy himself. What he denies with his words, however, is undermined by his actions.<br> <br>An important distinction needs to be made at this point between objects that we seek because we feel (whether rightly or wrongly) that they will improve our life in some way and objects that we believe will fill the gap we experience at the very core of our existence. For example, one person may wish to make money in order to look after her family or gain some extra comfort, while someone else might pursue money in a way that suggests they think that wealth will provide them with ultimate meaning.<br> <br>There is a very simple but vital mechanism that transforms an object from being something we would like to something we believe would make us whole: a prohibition. Whenever something we would like is refused to us in some way, this refusal causes us to want the object even more.<br> <br>We can see this happening in a very transparent way while watching children play. We might imagine a child wanting to play with a toy he sees but is denied access to by a parent. By this act of prohibition, the child&#x2019;s normal desire for the object is transformed into something much more potent. He is likely to invest that toy with a significance not merited by the toy itself.<br> <br>This prohibition was called &#x201c;the Law&#x201d; by the Apostle Paul. He understood that the prohibition of the Law does not cause one to renounce an object but rather fuels a self-destructive drive for it. This is a subject that we will take up in more detail in the following chapter.<br> <br>I Need the Rabbit&#x2019;s Foot<br> <br>Hollywood has made billions playing into this human experience of the gap, providing myths in which the lost object we believe will make us whole is finally gained. Film theorists call this lost object the MacGuffin, a term popularized by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1930s. The MacGuffin is a name that is given to whatever object helps drive the narrative forward, providing the necessary tension to keep an audience interested. The MacGuffin is that X for which some or all of the main characters are willing to sacrifice everything. In this way the object they seek is more than something they want in order to make their lives a little better; it is something that evokes in them an obsessive form of desire. The object might take the form of money, fame, victory, power, a man, or a woman. The point is not what actually fills the role of the MacGuffin, but that there is something that has that role, something that people want in some excessive way. It is the object for which everything will be sacrificed, the object that seems to promise fulfillment, satisfaction, and lasting pleasure.<br> <br>One particularly interesting example of a MacGuffin in action can be seen in J. J. Abrams&#x2019;s film <i>Mission: Impossible III.</i> For here the director hints at the MacGuffin&#x2019;s utterly contingent nature.<br> <br>The entire movie revolves around a mysterious object called the Rabbit&#x2019;s Foot. All the main players in the movie desperately seek this object, and yet at no point do we ever learn exactly what the Rabbit&#x2019;s Foot actually is. This is brought home most clearly in one scene where a technician working for the IMF (Impossible Missions Force) christens this enigmatic object of desire with the name &#x201c;Anti-God&#x201d;&#x2014;a name that gives us a glimpse into the very nature of the MacGuffin. For if God is understood as the source of everything, then the name &#x201c;Anti-God&#x201d; brings to mind nothingness itself.<br> <br>By refusing to give the object any real content, <i>Mission: Impossible III</i> hints at the provisional and ultimately superfluous nature of the MacGuffin. The movie shows how it acts as a type of void, a void that produces all the conflict and desire. It is a nothing that produces everything. It is <i>creatio ex nihilo</i> in action.<br> <br>In reality, the movie does give the impression that the Rabbit&#x2019;s Foot has some positive content when it implies that the black market arms dealer knows what it is. What might have made the movie more intellectually satisfying would have been a final twist, one where we discover that the only reason the arms dealer is so obsessed with possessing the Rabbit&#x2019;s Foot is because he mistakenly thinks the Impossible Missions Force wants it. In this way the Rabbit&#x2019;s Foot could have existed in the movie as a pure fabrication without any specific content, a nothing that gains its significance purely through a misunderstanding.<br><br>In life we find ourselves pursuing various MacGuffins&#x2014;impotent things we falsely believe will make us whole.<br><br>In life we find ourselves pursuing various MacGuffins&#x2014;impotent things we falsely believe will make us whole. What we see in the structure of Hollywood movies is but a clear reflection of this structure. And just as Hollywood movies generally hide the impotence of what we seek, so our dreams and fantasies do the same&#x2014;ultimately covering over the fact that what we think will satisfy our souls is really powerless to do so.<br> <br>The Originality of Original Sin<br> <br>This idea of a gap at the core of our being has an ancient theological name: Original Sin. Unfortunately this term has all but lost its depth and credibility due to its misuse by the church today. But if we consider Original Sin in its most literal definition, we can begin to appreciate how it refers to a primal separation&#x2014;for &#x201c;sin&#x201d; means separation, and &#x201c;original&#x201d; refers to that which comes first. In this way Original Sin is simply the ancient theological name given to the experience that we have outlined above. It is a phrase that refers to the feeling of gap that marks us all from the very beginning.<br> <br>We have seen how this nothing at the core of our being causes us to imagine something that might fill it, something that would make us whole. But this belief in something that would finally bring satisfaction is nothing more than a fantasy we create, a fantasy that fuels the obsessive drive we have for books, talks, and people who promise a life of total sexual, emotional, and/or spiritual fulfillment. This Original Sin is the very thing that causes us to falsely think it is not original at all. This sense of gap makes us think that there must have been something before it, an original blessing that we somehow lost.<br> <br>Sadly, almost the entire existing church fails to embrace the full radicality of what Original Sin actually means, for they presuppose that there is something we are separated from, something that will bring wholeness and insight.<br></p><h2>Huck</h2><p>In a quiet seaside town, a gas station clerk named Huck secretly uses his special gifts to do a good deed each day.

Leatherman has written or edited 16 books, including <i>Sea Level Rise: Causes and Consequences</i> and America's Best Beaches. <br><br>JACK WILLIAMS is the founding weather editor for<i> USA Today </i>and the author or co-author of six books including <i>The American Meteorological Society Weather Book: The Ultimate Guide to America's Weather</i>.<b>Beachcombing Basics</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Almost every beach visitor does a little beachcombing along the ocean&#x2019;s edge to see what the tide has washed in. It is a relaxing escape from everyday concerns. Other people take their beachcombing seriously, making a hobby or even a business of collecting what they like among the many objects they find. Whether you are casual or serious, beachcombing helps you connect with the ocean and some of its creatures.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Start with the Wrack Line</b><br> Wrack refers to several species of living seaweed, as well as dead vegetation of all kinds, that are washed up by waves and often are concentrated along the high-tide line, which is called the wrack line. This long row of debris stretching along the beach almost always offers fascinating discoveries&#x2014;for example, the seaweed called sargassum, which contains little brown balls. The balls keep the sargassum afloat as it circles the Sargasso Sea, a huge eddy in the middle of the Atlantic. Pieces of sargassum, including their little floats, break off and drift to beaches along the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. In wrack lines you can find many of the items that are described in this chap- ter. In fact, wrack lines sometimes contain more living things than any other part of a beach. Walk along the line slowly, look carefully, and you may find many creatures that you have never seen before. Wrack offers protection, nutrients, and moisture to an entire food web that includes tiny shrimplike creatures, mole crabs, ghost crabs, and shorebirds such as terns that are foraging for a meal. Seeds and nutrients in wrack washed onto the back beach may help plants become established to stabilize new dunes.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Rules for Beachcombing</b><br> Before collecting any seashells, be aware that there may be strict government regulations to follow or private property to respect. In many locations you are not permitted to take whatever strikes your fancy. In some areas, it may be forbidden to collect seashells containing live animals and even to take empty shells. Always check for possible regulations because illegal collecting may result in substantial fines. Two examples:<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Pay attention to strict regulations banning the collection of abalone, which are large, edible sea snails, along the California coast. <br> 2. Florida prohibits collection of beautiful queen conchs, which have edible meat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even where collecting mollusks is legal, you should not interfere with nature&#x2019;s food web by taking any living mollusk. Taking items besides living creatures may also be prohibited. For example, the National Park Service forbids removing sea glass or pottery from Spectacle Island in Boston Harbor, a prime site for finding sea glass.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is especially important to learn the rules before beachcombing at national wildlife refuges, national sea- shores, and state parks&#x2014;but wildlife regulations may also apply to private property. There is another good reason not to collect shells containing living animals: When the creature dies and begins to decay, its odor may quickly become unbearable, perhaps like that of rotting fish.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Sea Glass and Plastic</b><br> Many beachcombers collect pieces of glass that waves, sand, and water have tumbled and smoothed over many years, creating unique shapes, colors, and textures. Some collectors use them to make sea glass jewelry or art objects. The North American Sea Glass Association links collectors with its newsletter and collecting conventions. As plastic containers increasingly replace glass ones, sea glass is getting harder to find. Most beachcombers view the large amount of plastic waste on beaches as unsightly garbage.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Did You Know?</b><br> Black patches of beach sand do not usually come from oil spills? More often these patches contain minerals darker than the usual quartz sand.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Safety Tip</b><br> Do not pick up or prod unrecognized man-made items such as metal canisters; unexploded bombs or mines sometimes wash ashore.</p><h2>Confucius Lives Next Door: What Living in the East Teaches Us About Living in the West</h2><p>"Fascinating...clearly stated, interesting and provoking....

This entertaining and thoughtful book invites the reader to consider East Asia's other miracle: its dramatically low rates of crime, divorce, drug abuse, and other social ills. T.R. Reid, an NPR commentator and former Tokyo bureau chief for the <i>Washington Post</i>, lived in Japan for five years, and he draws on this experience to show how the countries of East Asia have built modern industrial societies characterized by the safest streets, the best schools, and the most stable families in the world. <p> Reid credits Asia's success to the ethical values of Chinese philosopher Confucius, born in 551 B.C., who taught the value of harmony and the importance of treating others decently. This is not a new perception--Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and others have rather heavy-handedly invoked it to claim moral superiority over the West--but the author's vivid anecdotes strengthen its relevance. Public messages constantly remind Asian citizens of their responsibilities to society. To enhance a sense of belonging, civic ceremonies encourage individuals' allegiance to a greater good; across Japan, for example, April 1 is Nyu-Sha-Shiki day, when corporations officially welcome new employees, most of whom remain loyal to their company for life. Citing Malaysia's ideas of a "reverse Peace Corps," Reid sees a case for Asians coming to teach the West in the same way that Westerners have evangelized in Asia for over four centuries. <i>--John Stevenson</i></p>Anyone who has heard his weekly commentary on NPR knows that T.

He was a prolific writer and recognized as a genius. In 1907 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. His many books for children include Just So Stories and The Jungle Book.<b>Chapter I</b><br><i><br>Oh ye who tread the Narrow Way<br><br>By Tophet-flare to Judgment Day,<br><br>Be gentle when the heathen pray<br><br> To Buddha at Kamakura!</i><br><br> He sat, in defiance of municipal orders, astride the gun Zam- Zammah on her brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher&#x2014;the Wonder House, as the natives call the Lahore Museum. Who hold Zam-Zammah, that &#x201c;fire-breathing dragon,&#x201d; hold the Punjab; for the great green-bronze piece is always first of the conqueror&#x2019;s loot.<br><br>There was some justification for Kim,&#x2014;he had kicked Lala Dinanath&#x2019;s boy off the trunnions,&#x2014;since the English held the Punjab and Kim was English. Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white&#x2014;a poor white of the very poorest. The half-caste woman who looked after him (she smoked opium, and pretended to keep a second-hand furniture shop by the square where the cheap cabs wait) told the missionaries that she was Kim&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s sister; but his mother had been nursemaid in a colonel&#x2019;s family and had married Kimball O&#x2019;Hara, a young colour-sergeant of the Mavericks, an Irish regiment. He afterwards took a post on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi railway, and his regiment went home without him. The wife died of cholera in Ferozepore, and O&#x2019;Hara fell to drink and loafing up and down the line with the keen-eyed three-year-old baby. Societies and chaplains anxious for the child, tried to catch him, but O&#x2019;Hara drifted away, till he came across the woman who took opium and learned the taste from her, and died as poor whites die in India. His estate at death consisted of three papers&#x2014;one he called his &#x201c;ne varietur&#x201d; because those words were written below his signature thereon, and another his &#x201c;clearance-certificate.&#x201d; The third was Kim&#x2019;s birth-certificate. Those things, he was used to say, in his glorious opium hours, would yet make little Kimball a man. On no account was Kim to part with them, for they belonged to a great piece of magic&#x2014;such magic as men practised over yonder behind the Museum, in the big blue and white Jadoo-Gher&#x2014;the Magic House, as we name the Masonic Lodge. It would, he said, all come right some day, and Kim&#x2019;s horn would be exalted between pillars&#x2014;monstrous pillars&#x2014;of beauty and strength. The Colonel himself, riding on a horse, at the head of the finest regiment in the world, would attend to Kim,&#x2014;little Kim that should have been better off than his father. Nine hundred first-class devils, whose god was a Red Bull on a green field, would attend to Kim, if they had not forgotten O&#x2019;Hara&#x2014;poor O&#x2019;Hara that was gang-foreman on the Ferozepore line. Then he would weep bitterly in the broken rush chair on the verandah. So it came about after his death that the woman sewed parchment, paper, and birth-certificate into a leather amulet-case which she strung round Kim&#x2019;s neck.<br><br>&#x201c;And some day,&#x201d; she said, confusedly remembering O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s prophecies, &#x201c;there will come for you a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and&#x201d;&#x2014;dropping into English&#x2014;&#x201c;nine hundred devils.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Kim, &#x201c;I shall remember. A Red Bull and a Colonel on a horse will come, but first, my father said, come the two men making ready the ground for these matters. That is how, my father said, they always did; and it is always so when men work magic.&#x201d;<br><br>If the woman had sent Kim up to the local Jadoo-Gher with those papers, he would, of course, have been taken over by the Provincial Lodge and sent to the Masonic Orphanage in the Hills; but what she had heard of magic she distrusted. Kim, too, held views of his own. As he reached the years of indiscretion, he learned to avoid missionaries and white men of serious aspect who asked who he was, and what he did. For Kim did nothing with an immense success. True, he knew the wonderful walled city of Lahore from the Delhi Gate to the outer Fort Ditch; was hand in glove with men who led lives stranger than anything Haroun al Raschid dreamed of; and he lived in a life wild as that of the Arabian Nights, but missionaries and secretaries of charitable societies could not see the beauty of it. His nickname through the wards was &#x201c;Little Friend of all the World&#x201d;; and very often, being lithe and inconspicuous, he executed commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion. It was intrigue, of course,&#x2014;he knew that much, as he had known all evil since he could speak,&#x2014;but what he loved was the game for its own sake&#x2014;the stealthy prowl through the dark gullies and lanes, the crawl up a water-pipe, the sights and sounds of the women&#x2019;s world on the flat roofs, and the headlong flight from housetop to housetop under cover of the hot dark. Then there were holy men, ash-smeared faquirs by their brick shrines under the trees at the riverside, with whom he was quite familiar&#x2014;greeting them as they returned from begging-tours, and, when no one was by, eating from the same dish. The woman who looked after him insisted with tears that he should wear European clothes&#x2014;trousers, a shirt, and a battered hat. Kim found it easier to slip into Hindu or Mohammedan garb when engaged on certain businesses. One of the young men of fashion&#x2014;he who was found dead at the bottom of a well on the night of the earthquake&#x2014;had once given him a complete suit of Hindu kit, the costume of a low-caste street boy, and Kim stored it in a secret place under some baulks in Nila Ram&#x2019;s timber-yard, beyond the Punjab High Court, where the fragrant deodar logs lie seasoning after they have driven down the Ravee. When there was business or frolic afoot, Kim would use his properties, returning at dawn to the verandah, all tired out from shouting at the heels of a marriage procession, or yelling at a Hindu festival. Sometimes there was food in the house, more often there was not, and Kim went out again to eat with his native friends.<br><br>As he drummed his heels against Zam-Zammah he turned now and again from his king-of-the-castle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the sweetmeat-seller&#x2019;s son, to make a rude remark to the native policeman on guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door. The big Punjabi grinned tolerantly: he knew Kim of old. So did the water-carrier, sluicing water on the dry road from his goat-skin bag. So did Jawahir Singh, the Museum carpenter, bent over new packing-cases. So did everybody in sight except the peasants from the country, hurrying up to the Wonder House to view the things that men made in their own province and elsewhere. The Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures, and anybody who sought wisdom could ask the curator to explain.<br><br>&#x201c;Off! Off! Let me up!&#x201d; cried Abdullah, climbing up Zam- Zammah&#x2019;s wheel.<br><br>&#x201c;Thy father14 was a pastry-cook, Thy mother stole the ghi,&#x201d; sang Kim. &#x201c;All Mussalmans fell off Zam-Zammah long ago!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me up!&#x201d; shrilled little Chota Lal in his gilt-embroidered cap. His father was worth perhaps half a million sterling, but India is the only democratic land in the world.<br><br>&#x201c;The Hindus fell off Zam-Zammah too. The Mussalmans pushed them off. Thy father was a pastry-cook&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the roaring Motee Bazar,16 such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all castes, had never seen. He was nearly six feet high, dressed in fold upon fold of dingy stuff like horse-blanketing, and not one fold of it could Kim refer to any known trade or profession. At his belt hung a long open-work iron pencase and a wooden rosary such as holy men wear. On his head was a gigantic sort of tam-o&#x2019;-shanter. His face was yellow and wrinkled, like that of Fook Shing, the Chinese bootmaker in the bazar. His eyes turned up at the corners and looked like little slits of onyx.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is that?&#x201d; said Kim to his companions.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps it is a man,&#x201d; said Abdullah, finger in mouth, staring.<br><br>&#x201c;Without doubt,&#x201d; returned Kim; &#x201c;but he is no man of India that I have ever seen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A priest, perhaps,&#x201d; said Chota Lal, spying the rosary. &#x201c;See! He goes into the Wonder House!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nay, nay,&#x201d; said the policeman, shaking his head. &#x201c;I do not understand your talk.&#x201d; The constable spoke Punjabi. &#x201c;Oh, The Friend of all the World, what does he say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Send him hither,&#x201d; said Kim, dropping from Zam-Zammah, flourishing his bare heels. &#x201c;He is a foreigner, and thou art a buffalo.&#x201d;<br><br>The man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys. He was old, and his woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking artemisia of the mountain passes.<br><br>&#x201c;O Children, what is that big house?&#x201d; he said in very fair Urdu.<br><br>&#x201c;The Ajaib-Gher, the Wonder House!&#x201d; Kim gave him no title&#x2014;such as Lala or Mian. He could not divine the man&#x2019;s creed.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah! The Wonder House! Can any enter?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is written above the door&#x2014;all can enter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Without payment?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I go in and out. I am no banker,&#x201d; laughed Kim.<br><br>&#x201c;Alas! I am an old man. I did not know.&#x201d; Then, fingering his rosary, he half turned to the Museum.<br><br>&#x201c;What is your caste? Where is your house? Have you come far?&#x201d; Kim asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I came by Kulu&#x2014;from beyond the Kailas&#x2014;but what know you? From the hills where&#x201d;&#x2014;he sighed&#x2014;&#x201c;the air and water are fresh and cool.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aha! Khitai (a Chinaman),&#x201d; said Abdullah proudly. Fook Shing had once chased him out of his shop for spitting at the joss above the boots.<br><br>&#x201c;Pahari (a hillman),&#x201d; said little Chota Lal.<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, child&#x2014;a hillman from hills thou&#x2019;lt never see. Didst hear of Bhotiyal (Tibet)? I am no Khitai, but a Bhotiya (Tibetan), since you must know&#x2014;a lama&#x2014;or, say a guru in your tongue.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A guru from Tibet,&#x201d; said Kim. &#x201c;I have not seen such a man. They be Hindus in Tibet, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We be followers of the Middle Way, living in peace in our lamasseries, and I go to see the Four Holy Places before I die. Now do you, who are children, know as much as I do who am old.&#x201d; He smiled benignantly on the boys.<br><br>&#x201c;Hast thou eaten?&#x201d;<br><br>He fumbled in his bosom and drew forth a worn wooden begging-bowl. The boys nodded. All priests of their acquaintance begged.<br><br>&#x201c;I do not wish to eat yet.&#x201d; He turned his head like an old tortoise in the sunlight. &#x201c;Is it true that there are many images in the Wonder House of Lahore?&#x201d; He repeated the last words as one making sure of an address.<br><br>&#x201c;That is true,&#x201d; said Abdullah. &#x201c;It is full of heathen b�uts. Thou also art an idolator.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind him,&#x201d; said Kim. &#x201c;That is the Government&#x2019;s house and there is no idolatry in it, but only a Sahib with a white beard. Come with me and I will show.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Strange priests eat boys,&#x201d; whispered Chota Lal.<br><br>&#x201c;And he is a stranger and a b�ut-parast (idolator),&#x201d; said Abdullah, the Mohammedan.<br><br>Kim laughed. &#x201c;He is new. Run to your mothers&#x2019; laps, and be safe.

But what if children&#39;s ministries were rooted in a mind set whereby we taught children, with our words and actions, how the story of God, the story of church history, the story of the local community, and the story of the child intersect and speak to one another? What if children&#39;s ministry was less about downloading information into kids&#39; heads and more about leading them into these powerful, compelling stories? Beckwith aims to help ministers and parents create a ministry that captures children&#39;s imaginations not just to keep them occupied, but to live as citizens of the kingdom of God. In addition to providing theological reasons for formational children&#39;s ministry, the book offers examples of how Ivy and other practitioners are implementing a formational model.</p><p>"This is a genius book, written by an enormously gifted child educator who will help you reconceptualize your ministry to children.

After all, we ourselves are the product of evolution, and we can tackle many of our gravest challenges &#x2013;&#x2013; from lethal resurgence of antiobiotic&#x2013;resistant diseases to the wave of extinctions that looms before us &#x2013;&#x2013; with a sound understanding of the science.</p></p><p>While its opponents may sneer that "it's just a theory," evolution has transcended that label to take its place as one of the most important ideas in human history. Science journalist Carl Zimmer explores its history and future in <i>Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea</i>, a companion piece to the epic PBS series of the same name. The book, lavishly illustrated with photos of our distant cousins, anatomical diagrams, and timelines, is as beautiful as it is enlightening. While those closely following the field will find little more here than a well-written summation of the state of the art in 2001, readers who have watched the evolutionary debates from a distance will quickly catch up with the details of the principal arguments.<p> Zimmer's text is fresh and expansive, explaining both the minutiae of comparative anatomy and the grand scale of geological time with verve and clarity. Following the trend of turn-of-the-century evolution writers, he treats the religious beliefs of creationists with respect, while firmly insisting that the scientific evidence against their position is too compelling to ignore. Touching on biology, philosophy, theology, politics, and nearly every other field of human thought, <i>Evolution</i> will inspire its readers with the elegance and importance of Darwin's simple theory. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p>Carl Zimmer is the author of three well-received books on evolution.

Over the course of four and a half millennia, Cairo has eluded all who would try to pin it down, reinventing itself time and again: "It has survived countless invasions, booms and busts, famines, plagues, and calamities." Author Max Rodenbeck, a correspondent for the <i>Economist</i>, moved to Cairo as a 2 year old, and has spent a good portion of his professional life working there. He finds himself repulsed by the crowds and pollution of a late 20th-century megacity, yet drawn by Cairo's ageless vibrancy. <i>Cairo: The City Victorious</i> combines wide-ranging history and first-person travelogue in an unconventional narrative that bounces easily from the present to the past and back again. ("If the story were to loop and tangle and digress," he writes, "well, that too would be in the character of Cairo.") Immersed in Rodenbeck's prose, readers will find themselves feeling at home as they discover (or rediscover) this unique place, its pyramids, and its people. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Al-Qahira: Her Arab conquerors called her "the Victorious", and over the course of her 5,000-year history Cairo has richly merited the name.

Whether he is exploring a belly-dance theater or a medieval mosque, a hashish den or a dusty bazaar, Rodenbeck brings Cairo to life in all its chaotic beauty.

The man&#x2019;s family is being held captive by the Iranian government so there&#x2019;s little chance he would ever defect, but the British (concerned about the possibility of Iran becoming a nuclear power) see a window of opportunity. The man is scheduled to be in Paris, and he happens to be acquainted with Sara Gideon, the intelligence agent who has recently joined the small band of operatives led by series hero Sean Dillon. Gideon and Dillon&#x2019;s mission: meet up with the man in Paris and convince him to turn over his research. Possibility of success: strong. Possibility of mishap leading to dire consequences and life-threatening danger: even stronger. This is another sturdy action thriller with political overtones from one of the masters of the genre. Fans of the long-running Dillon series will flock to this latest entry, and the reappearance of Sara Gideon (who was introduced in 2012&#x2019;s A Devil Is Waiting) injects the book with some serious new energy. Good stuff. --David Pitt</p><h2>Preaching the New Lectionary: Year C</h2><p><p>The Lectionary is made up of selected passages from the Bible, placed within a literary and liturgical context. This new context calls for a consideration of the liturgical character and setting of the Lectionary readings. <i>Preaching the New Lectionary: Year C</i>, offers readers that interpretation.</p><p><i>Preaching the New Lectionary</i> is unique. First, it employs a literary-liturgical way of interpreting all the readings of each Sunday and major feast of the liturgical year, including the often overlooked responsorial psalm. Second, it explicitly situates the interpretation of each day within the theology of its respective liturgical season. This theology is drawn from the specific themes of the readings that comprise that particular year rather than from more general themes associated with the season. The meaning of the entire season becomes the context for understanding the individual parts of it. Third, the lections are also read in sequential order from the first Sunday of that season to the last. This reading interprets the function of the literary forms, thus providing yet another way of interpreting the riches of the readings.</p><p>This way of reading and understanding the Lectionary has potential for liturgical ministry. It can quicken the religious imagination of homilists, thus providing fresh new possibilities for liturgical preaching. It offers creative insights for those involved in the liturgical preparation for the celebration of feasts and seasons. It can also act as a valuable resource for liturgical catechesis. The insights included in <i>Preaching the New Lectionary</i> contribute toward enhancing the liturgical lives of the faithful.</p></p><p>Dianne Bergant, CSA, is the Carroll Stuhlmueller, CP, Distinguished Professor of Old Testament Studies at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.

But perhaps the most shocking thing about Flannery O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s fiction is the fact that it is shaped by a thoroughly Christian vision. If the world she depicts is dark and terrifying, it is also the place where grace makes itself known. Her world&#x2014;our world&#x2014;is the stage whereon the divine comedy plays out; the freakishness and violence in O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s stories, so often mistaken for a kind of misanthropy or even nihilism, turn out to be a call to mercy.</p><p>In this biography, Jonathan Rogers gets at the heart of O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s work.

Front and back matter provide kana contractions plus more information about the kana systems. Almost 40 pages are devoted to practice grids, unnecessary for library readers.

She catapulted to fame after winning <i> Motion Picture </i> magazine's 1921 " Fame and Fortune" contest. The greatest box-office draw of her day&#x2015;she once received 45,000 fan letters in a single month, Clara Bow's on screen vitality and allure that beguiled thousands, however, would be her undoing off-camera. David Stenn captures her legendary rise to stardom and fall from grace, her success marred by studio exploitation and sexual scandals.</p><p>In his first book, Stenn, a screenwriter, has produced a movie biography that tops most of the current crop of Hollywood stories. Assiduously researched, the book contains hitherto unpublished material from Clara Bow's son and others who knew the screen goddess who expressed the spirit of flaming youth during the 1920s. Mistreated by a psychotic mother and abusive father, Bow grew up in the Brooklyn slum where she was born in 1902. She escaped by winning a "fame and fortune" contest in her teens and a part in a silent film. Before long the pretty redhead's singular talents made her extremely popular with producers and public alike. She personified sex as fun, earning the sobriquet "The It Girl," coined by Elinor Glyn to define her allure. The actress lived the role offscreen as well, having affairs with Gary Cooper, Gilbert Roland, Victor Fleming and others, creating scandals that prompted even her amoral father to ask her, "Why can't you be like Lillian Gish?" But as Stenn's admirably balanced profile shows, Bow was not as wild as accounts paint her. Notoriety, nevertheless, ended her career before she was 30, after starring in numerous silents as well as early talkies for which she learned to temper her Brooklynese accent. Apart from one or two roles, like her part in the World War I aviation epic Wings , her films did not show the real gifts of this star who was usually cast in profitable potboilers, notes Stenn. Bow, married to Rex Bell and living in semi-seclusion, died in 1965. In this sensitive biography, readers will find a vibrant woman to empathize with, as well as an engrossing history of early picture-making.

The world of the Gold Rush that comes down to us through fiction and film&#x2015;of unshaven men named Stumpy and Kentuck raising hell and panning for gold&#x2015;is one of half-truths. In this brilliant work of social history, Susan Johnson enters the well-worked diggings of Gold Rush history and strikes a rich lode. She finds a dynamic social world in which the conventions of identity&#x2015;ethnic, national, and sexual&#x2015;were reshaped in surprising ways. She gives us the all-male households of the diggings, the mines where the men worked, and the fandango houses where they played. With a keen eye for character and story, Johnson restores the particular social world that issued in the Gold Rush myths we still cherish.

Johnson (History/Univ. of Colorado) argues that the commonly held view of the gold rush leaves out many of its principal actors; derived in large part from the chummy, mud-spattered writings of Bret Harte, that view centers on Anglo-American miners while elbowing thousands of Eastern-European, South-American, African-American, Mexican, and Chinese workers into the backgroundto say nothing of the Native Americans on whose territory the gold rush took place. Johnson looks beyond Hartes tales of camaraderie to depict the California gold camps as hotbeds of ethnic and cultural strife, battlegrounds on which Anglo- Americans not only sought their personal fortunes but asserted political dominion over the region, newly conquered from Mexico, a task that made them anxious about issues of gender, of race and culture, and of class. Their attempts to impose this control, Johnson suggests, were often misguided. A monthly $20 tax on foreign (that is, non-Anglo) miners, for instance, drove away much-needed cooks, haulers, and common laborers, and it was soon done away with. Johnson turns up useful correctivesfor one, that most Chinese workers came to California freely, rather than as indentured laborersand gives needed attention to the Miwok and other Indian peoples who often fell afoul of the gold seekers, sometimes because of simple cultural misunderstandings. The more interesting threads of her argument, however, are buried in a surfeit of incidental detail, and her narrative too often becomes a mere recitation of undigested facts, betraying its origins as a doctoral dissertation. Published a shade too late to join the flood of books commemorating the 150th anniversary of the gold rush, Johnsons study makes a useful yet decidedly secondary reference for scholars and students of the period. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But what if there were sea serpents and giant man-eating lobsters waiting just off course if we were to lose our way? Would there be an app for that? In the sixteenth century, these and other monsters were thought to swim the northern waters, threatening seafarers who ventured too far from shore. Thankfully, Scandinavian mariners had Olaus Magnus, who in 1539 charted these fantastic marine animals in his influential map of the Nordic countries, the <i>Carta Marina</i>. In <i>Sea Monsters</i>, well-known expert on magical beasts Joseph Nigg brings readers face-to-face with these creatures, alongside the other magnificent components of Magnus&#x2019;s map.<br>Nearly two meters wide in total, the map&#x2019;s nine wood-block panels comprise the largest and first realistic portrayal of Northern Europe. But in addition to these important geographic elements, Magnus&#x2019;s map goes beyond cartography to scenes both domestic and mystic. Close to shore, Magnus shows humans interacting with common sea life&#x2014;boats struggling to stay afloat, merchants trading, children swimming, and fisherman pulling lines<i>. </i>But from the offshore deeps rise some of the most magical and terrifying sea creatures imaginable at the time or thereafter&#x2014;like sea swine, whales as large as islands, and the Kraken. In this book, Nigg provides a thorough tour of the map&#x2019;s cartographic details, as well as a colorful look at its unusual pictorial and imaginative elements. He draws on Magnus&#x2019;s own text to further describe and illuminate the inventive scenes and to flesh out the stories of the monsters.<br><i>Sea Monsters </i>is a stunning tour of a world that still holds many secrets for us land dwellers, who will forever be fascinated by reports of giant squid and the real-life creatures of the deep that have proven to be as bizarre and otherworldly as we have imagined for centuries.

Written for emergent leaders in any endeavor, this new work from renowned consultant Richard Strozzi-Heckler offers a new approach to leadership. The first book of its kind to base business and management strength on integral body awareness, the book presents key principles such as <i>shugyo, </i>or self-cultivation, as crucial in developing the individual responsibility, social commitment, and moral and spiritual vision required to lead with authority and efficacy. <i>The Leadership Dojo </i>is based on three questions: What does a leader do? What are the character values most essential to exemplary leadership? How do you teach these values? Drawing on the wisdom of ages from Plato to the Bhagavad-Gita, from Thucydides to the Abidharma, the book asserts that understanding and answering these questions holds the key to superior leadership skills. Strozzi-Heckler teaches with real-world examples based on his wide experience training decision-makers at companies like AT&amp;T and Microsoft. The book&#x2019;s multifaceted approach helps readers establish a powerful Leadership Presence, a platform from which they can take ethical action with compassion and pragmatic wisdom.</p><p>Richard Strozzi-Heckler, PhD is the author of the nationally acclaimed <i>In Search of the Warrior Spirit</i>, which chronicles his training of the Green Berets and his vision of reclaiming traditional warrior virtues in a technologically-oriented society. He also authored <i>The Anatomy of Change, Holding the Center: A Sanctuary in Times of Confusion</i>, and <i>The Mind/Body Interface. </i>Having worked with tens of thousands of people over the last 30 years including corporate executives, Olympic and professional athletes, managers, political leaders, and inner-city gangs, Strozzi-Heckler&#x2019;s client list includes U.S. Marines, U.S. Army Green Berets, U.S. Navy SEALS, AT&amp;T, DMV, Microsoft, Sportsmind, Capital One, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Hewlett-Packard.<b>Introduction</b>In 1985, after sixteen years of working primarily with individuals and training professionals in a body-oriented psychology, I embarked on a new and unanticipated direction. I was selected to be part of a team that designed and conducted a bold and experimental training for the Army Special Forces. Our task was to increase the physical fitness, mental enhancement, and team cohesion of the Army&#x2019;s Special Force&#x2019;s soldier. In the words of an officer who promoted the program, &#x201c;To train a holistic soldier.&#x201d; For six months our team introduced twenty-five Green Berets to the newest methods of mind/body/spirit integration including aikido, other martial arts, nutrition, physical fitness training, stress reduction, meditation, warrior values, healing arts, team building, and communication skills. Code-named the Trojan Warrior Project after the Greek soldiers who hid inside the belly of a wooden horse this classified experiment produced positive off-the-chart results in every area tested. Even though these men were the most highly trained soldiers in the United States Army they radically improved their existing scores in the areas of physical fitness, mental alertness, team alignment, psychological balance, and moral integrity. The results of the Trojan Warrior Project made it apparent that the research I had been conducting in human performance for almost two decades with individuals and small groups could be accomplished in teams and organizations, with significant impact. At the conclusion of the program when the men returned to their units a curious phenomenon began to occur. Their commanding officers began reporting how the leadership skills of these men had dramatically improved. This was unexpected in that the curriculum of the Trojan Warrior Project was not specifically designed to address leadership issues, but to improve individual and team performance. Soon, the Trojan Warrior Project began to be referred to as a leadership program in military circles. Subsequent programs with the Navy Seals and Marine Corps produced similar comments from their senior leadership: the practices the men were doing created significant advances in their ability to lead, motivate, and mobilize their troops. While it made sense to me that the whole of one&#x2019;s life--professional and personal&#x2013;would positively be affected by the cultivation of mind, body, and spirit, it aroused my curiosity why the project produced such positive results in the area of leadership. Soon I began to look more closely at what was the fundamental ground upon which exemplary leadership stands and how it can be trained... With every team and organization I worked with I began by asking three questions. In an initial meeting with forty senior executives at AT&amp;T, for example, I proposed the question, &#x201c;What does a leader do?&#x201d; and I received forty different answers. Responses included: motivate others, execute plans, manage meetings, delegate responsibility, give orders, design strategies, produce organizational charts, make speeches, inspire, balance the budget, hire the right people, build alliances, mobilize skills, maintain an optimistic mood, until we had a white board filled with the varied activities that took up an executive&#x2019;s time. This informal poll was duplicated in other companies and inevitably it was the same--as many different answers as there were people. While all these activities were relevant it was clear to me that performing these tasks didn&#x2019;t necessarily make a successful leader. I wanted to know who was the person behind these activities? What ground of being did they embody to successfully perform these actions? My second question-&#x201c;What are the character values most essential to exemplary leadership?&#x201d;-produced an entirely different response. The answers fell into a consistent and predictable pattern. Whether the poll was taken with Chilean telecommunication executives, the senior leadership of the Marine Corps, thirty -something technology entrepreneurs, European financiers, Directors of non-profits, United States Senators, CEOs of Fortune 100 companies, or Canadian utilities executives, the same virtues unfailing appeared. Honesty, accountability, integrity, vision, commitment, empathy, courage, trustworthiness, and self-control showed up time and again as the hallmarks of a leader. The literature and research on the character aspects of leadership also reflected this response. There seemed to be a universal consensus about the type of character values necessary for leadership and leading an honorable life. Moreover, this list of values was anything but new. As far back as Plato and Thucyides in the West, and the Indian epic <i>Bhagavad-Gita</i> and Buddhist text <i>Abidharma</i> in East, these attributes have long been distinguished as the cornerstones of exemplary leadership, and life. It seems that as long as human beings have recorded their history there has been universal agreement about what kind of person is a successful leader. When I asked my final question, &#x201c;How do you teach these virtues?&#x201d; I was met with blank stares. It seemed I had reached the end of the trail. Most managers and leaders could say very little about how the character values of leadership are learned and even among the brightest the conversation descended into clich�s, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s either there or it isn&#x2019;t&#x201d;; &#x201c;You can lead a horse to water but you can&#x2019;t make him drink&#x201d;; &#x201c;Leaders are born not made.&#x201d; Presumably, this has something to do with the difficulty of measuring values, and business schools are notorious for demanding empirical measurements for everything. A typical refrain in the business world is, &#x201c;If it can&#x2019;t be measured don&#x2019;t manage it&#x201d;. Nonetheless, the point is we can give examples of a leader&#x2019;s behavior, but nothing about how it&#x2019;s learned. Bookstores are filled with stories of great leaders and what they did in certain situations, but nothing about how they got there. There&#x2019;s precious little written about the <i>how</i> of learning leadership and certainly no notable discourse representing it. It&#x2019;s as if we know what we&#x2019;re aiming for, and we can point to it when it&#x2019;s present, but we don&#x2019;t know how to get there.This book is about learning the human side of leadership and it&#x2019;s informed by a life long passion for learning and nearly three decades of studying how people excel and achieve mastery. This hasn&#x2019;t been an academic pursuit of pouring over texts but working closely with leaders and &#x2018;leaders to be&#x2019; in a wide variety of organizations. This includes the senior leadership of the Marine Corps (including the Commandant and Assistant Commandant), the command staff of the Special Operations Command, Navy Admirals, and a multitude of executives from large multinational corporations such as AT&amp;T, Microsoft, Citibank, Pfizer, British Petroleum, Cisco, Hewlett Packard, Cemex, American Express, as well as national utilities, non-profits, and small technological start-ups in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Working in these different environments it became apparent to me that leadership is something that can be learned and it&#x2019;s generated in relationship with others.</p><h2>Ostkrieg: Hitler&#39;s War of Extermination in the East</h2><p>On June 22, 1941, Germany launched the greatest land assault in history on the Soviet Union, an attack that Adolf Hitler deemed crucial to ensure German economic and political survival. As the key theater of the war for the Germans, the eastern front consumed enormous levels of resources and accounted for 75 percent of all German casualties. Despite the significance of this campaign to Germany and to the war as a whole, few English-language publications of the last thirty-five years have addressed these pivotal events.<br><br>In <i>Ostkrieg: Hitler's War of Extermination in the East</i>, Stephen G. Fritz bridges the gap in scholarship by incorporating historical research from the last several decades into an accessible, comprehensive, and coherent narrative. His analysis of the Russo-German War from a German perspective covers all aspects of the eastern front, demonstrating the interrelation of military events, economic policy, resource exploitation, and racial policy that first motivated the invasion. This in-depth account challenges accepted notions about World War II and promotes greater understanding of a topic that has been neglected by historians.</p><p><b>Stephen G.

There are many books dealing with military operations in the East and many others that highlight the atrocities, the murders, and the Holocaust. Not until now has a single volume attempted to incorporate both, seeking the nexus between military operations and mass murder. The result is as complete a history of the German-Soviet war as one could desire, and it is an achievement that is likely to be unequaled for some time to come."&#x2015;Robert M.

In Natchitoches, she's developed solid friendships and is dating a really great guy. Her sister, Teeny, is even beginning to recover from the trauma of their former lifestyle. Then Anna's missing journal is returned, along with a note from "T." Anna assumes it's from Thomas, the man hired to kill her, and the FBI agrees. Instead of going back into Witness Protection, the teen argues in favor of staying put, hoping that the FBI can apprehend Thomas before he finds her to finish his fatal task. He has a larger plan in place, however, and his accomplices are people Anna would never suspect. In order to outsmart them, she will have to think fast and stay strong&#x2014;especially when her boyfriend and sister get dragged into the danger zone. This sequel to The Rules for Disappearing (Hyperion, 2013) doesn't stand well on its own, as pertinent backstory is not sufficiently explained for the uninitiated. There is, however, significant character growth over the course of this novel. Anna is a fairly likable heroine who realistically goes from pawn to triumphant victor. The plot drags at the start, but picks up the pace as it progresses. The underlying mystery and fits of suspense will keep readers' attention.

Investigating Christianity as a lived experience, she opens each chapter with a voice from the field of religious studies and then presents answers to each chapter's question by surveying the history, doctrine, practices, and convictions of Christian churches.<p>Written for undergraduates with little or no background in the breadth of Christianity, the text of the book reports on the diversity of Christian belief and practice, and is accompanied with student-friendly learning helps, including side-bar definitions, art, photos, study questions, essay topics, and suggestions for further exploration in short stories, novels and films.</p></p><p>Gail Ramshaw is a scholar of liturgical language and professor of religion at La Salle University. She served on the Revised Common Lectionary design committee and on the Church&#39;s Year task force for the Renewing Worship project of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Her many publications include Christian Worship, Treasures Old and New, Between Sundays, and God beyond Gender, all from Fortress Press."In a culture marked by increasing levels of biblical and religious illiteracy, Gail Ramshaw offers the thoughtful student a cogent, straightforward, and engaging introduction to the study of Christianity. "<em>What is Christianity</em>?" leads students into a clear-eyed examination of what binds and separates millions of Christians across the globe. The work of a distinguished author and gifted teacher, "<em>What is Christianity</em>?" bears the imprint of many years in the classroom with skeptical and inquisitive undergraduates&#x2014;a gift to the thousands of us who teach university students week in and week out." --Samuel Torvend, Pacific Lutheran University<br><br>"Gail Ramshaw has written a textbook that is both accessible for undergraduates and innovative in its presentation of Christianity. By using a variety of scholars to introduce each chapter with an &#x2018;outsider's&#x2019; view, the book will appeal to the growing segment of &#x2018;noners&#x2019; who populate the required religion courses at many Christian-affiliated universities and colleges. At the end of each chapter is a gold mine of suggested activities, readings, and assignments that new and veteran professors will welcome." --Rhoda Schuler, Concordia University<br><br>"With lucid prose and with apt and arresting graphics, this text befriends the studious reader. Its organization for a comprehensive but comfortable semester, its opportunities for professorial creativity, and its erudition all together announce to the professor teaching an introductory course on Christian history&#x2014;Choose&#x2014; me." --Joseph Dougherty, La Salle University</p><h2>Seafurrers: The Ships&#x2019; Cats Who Lapped and Mapped the World</h2><p><b>A cat&#x2019;s-eye view of maritime history</b><br><br> We remember the bold seafarers of yore&#x2014;from Magellan to Shackleton&#x2014;for their extraordinary exploits: new lands discovered, storms weathered, and battles won.

Two years later, she&#39;s an art student at Cooper Union with a gallery job and a hip East Village walk-up. But when Ta Gorda calls with the news that Soledad&#39;s mother has lapsed into an emotional coma, she insists that Soledad&#39;s return is the only cure. Fighting the memories of open hydrants, leering men, and slick-skinned teen girls with raunchy mouths and snapping gum, Soledad moves home to West 164th Street. As she tries to tame her cousin Flaca&#39;s raucous behavior and to resist falling for Richie - a soulful, intense man from the neighborhood - she also faces the greatest challenge of her life: confronting the ghosts from her mother&#39;s past and salvaging their damaged relationship. Evocative and wise, Soledad is a wondrous story of culture and chaos, family and integrity, myth and mysticism, from a Latina literary light.</p><p><b>Angie Cruz</b> was born and raised in the Washington Heights section of New York City.

She is the author of <i>Soledad.</i><br>Visit the author at www.angiecruz.com.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>It's always like that: just when I think I don't give a shit about what my family thinks, they find a way to drag me back home.<br><br>A few weeks ago I receive this urgent phone call from my aunt Gorda.<br><br>You have to come home, Soledad, your mother is not doing so good.<br><br>Gorda expects a fight from me. She tells people that I was born con la pata caliente, feet burning to be anywhere but here. I say, it's more like those <i>Travel and Leisure</i> magazines my mother borrowed from the offices she cleaned that did it. When most kids wanted to go to Disney World, I begged to go to Venice so I could ride one of those gondolas. Even my earliest pastel drawings were of pagodas, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and Machu Picchu.<br><br>In some ways the travel and leisure fantasy continues because without trying I led my family to believe that I left 164th Street to live in the school dorms, which I kind of described to be more like high-rises, with a view of the East River and really great showers. For two years, they've had no idea. Every time I step inside my East Village walk-up on the corner of 6th and A, I feel guilty. Everything about it, the smell of piss, the halls as wide as my hips, the lightbulb in the lobby that flashes on and off like a cheap disco light, reminds me of my deception. But if they knew the truth (and how much I am paying for it), they'd declare me insane and send my uncle Victor to tie me up on the hood of his Camaro and bring me back home, kicking and screaming.<br><br>So although I dread it, I switch from the L train to the A and head uptown. I've learned not to make eye contact on the train. I try to avoid looking at the old lady who is an emaciated version of my grandmother, Do�a Sosa, without teeth. Like my grandmother, the old lady wears heavy pressed powder three shades lighter than her skin tone. Just looking at her makeup gives me allergies. I squeeze my bags between my legs, slip the silver necklace with a dangling peace sign inside my dress and double-wrap the strap of my knapsack around my hand. Out of all the things to wear uptown, I wear a tie-dye cotton skirt and strappy sandals. I should've at least worn sneakers. For a minute I delude myself into thinking that my family is sitting around my grandmother's kitchen eagerly awaiting my arrival. When the A train screeches its way up to 59th Street, I feel the little hairs on the back of my neck jump up like antennas. The tourists, the white folks, the kind of people who are too scared to go uptown, get off the train, leaving me behind. Once the train takes off from 59th Street there's no stopping it. Next stop is Harlem and then Spanish Harlem and then finally Washington Heights.<br><br>When I first moved downtown and people where I work asked me where I was from, I used to say the Upper West Side, vaguely.<br><br>Oh I really love it up there, they said, no doubt picturing Central Park and hordes of yuppified New Yorkers roller blading on a Sunday afternoon, or restaurants with outdoor seating that serve Italian gelato and crepes. I said it for so long that even I forgot that to most people Washington Heights is not even considered Manhattan. It's more like the Bronx. And because I knew that people associated what they saw on the news with the place I grew up in -- a war zone filled with cop killers, killer cops, crack dealers, gang members and lazy welfare mothers -- I convinced myself that embroidering the truth about my living on the Upper Upper Upper West Side was my way of keeping nasty stereotypes of Washington Heights out of people's minds.<br><br>But then I said it in front of my roommate, Caramel. She's a Chicana from Texas running away from the heat. When I told her I was from the Upper West Side, she cringed and looked at me pityingly.<br><br>How can you stand it up there? she asked horrified. It's like gringolandia.<br><br>I wasn't sure what she meant by that exactly, I just knew it was bad. It felt worse than being called a blanquita back home: a sellout, a wannabe white girl. So to calm her down I told her the truth, I'm from Washington Heights. In a loud Texan accent she boomed: Then say it like it is, mujer.<br><br>Washington Heights.<br><br>As soon as I arrive at 164th Street I'm attacked. I trip on the uneven sidewalk. The air-conditioners spit at me. The smell of onion and cilantro sting my eyes. I start to sneeze, the humidity is thick, sweat beads drip on the small of my back. Hydrants erupt, splashing cold water over the pavement. I know I should turn back while I still can, before anyone in my family sees me, but when potbellied, sockless men and pubescent homeboys call me mami, as if I'll give them the time of day if they stare at me long enough, I know I must keep moving forward. The last thing I want is to look lost or confused about where I'm going. There are more cops on the streets than fire hydrants. Merengue blares out of car speakers, the Dominican flag drapes in place of curtains on apartment windows, sneakers hang from lampposts, Presidente bottles, pizza boxes and old issues of <i>El Diario</i> burst out of the trash cans on the corner, a side of pernil grills by a building's basement. <br><br>The way I'm figuring it, my time in Washington Heights is like a prison sentence. Once I do the time, I won't have the guilt trip anymore about moving out. I'm twenty years old. Twenty years old is old enough to live away from home. Apparently not old enough for my aunt Gorda, who's almost forty and still lives with my grandmother, and Victor, who is about to hit thirty and won't leave my grandmother's pampering ways unless someone marries him and takes her place. But anyways, I promised Gorda I'll give my mother two, maybe three months. If my mother can't get her shit together in that time then that's it. I've already sacrificed a once-in-a-lifetime apprenticeship with a professor in Spain this summer. Finally I was offered the opportunity to travel far away to Europe, where I could taste grilled champi�ones and tortillas espa�olas, leisurely sit at a caf� during siesta and drink strong espresso in front of an ancient church. Me and Caramel had it all planned. We were supposed to meet up in Barcelona, where her gypsy t�a lives and then escape on a train to Paris following James Baldwin's footsteps.<br><br>Who's James Baldwin? I asked her.<br><br>Oh girl, you have so much to learn, Caramel said in her I'm-five-years-older-than-you-and-know-so-much-more-about-the-world voice.<br><br>I tried to tell Gorda that Europe couldn't wait. But she went on this trip about how I've forgotten the importance of familia.<br><br>What if you do go to Europe and something happens to your mother? You'll never be able to live with yourself, Soledad. That I know for sure.<br><br>And just when I think I'm going to make it home safe a hard splash of water falls from the sky and hits me in the head. Children begin laughing, circling around me. They're welcoming me to hell.<br><br>Fuck!<br><br>Parts of my skirt cling on to my skin. My sandals turn a deep dark brown. My nipples go erect. I put my hands over them. I drop my bags.<br><br>Do you need help?<br><br>Leave me alone. Get away from me, please.<br><br>This guy wearing a gold rope chain as thick as my wrist holds back a laugh. That makes me hate him instantly.<br><br>Chill. It came from the roof. Don't get mad at me. I'm trying to help.<br><br>Yeah right.<br><br>I give him the hand and look farther down the block toward my grandmother's building. I'm almost there. I know that once I find Gorda I will be fine. I breathe in through my nose out through my mouth. Deep breathing is supposed to help. I learned that from my art teacher, who takes a lot of yoga.<br><br>That's some language for a pretty girl.<br><br>As if I care about what he thinks. That's the problem with the guys around here. He thinks because he spends his life in the gym and gets dimples when he smiles that I'm going to listen to anything he has to say. Besides he's already causing me problems by making the girls wearing big door-knocker earrings, stretch denim jeans, hair slicked back tight into ponytails, popping chewing gum as if they're sending out Morse code to their homies, stare me up and down. They look like the girls who threatened to beat me up in high school. I really should've worn sneakers. I bet my cousin Flaca is among them. Gorda already told me how she can't get Flaca off the street.<br><br>Soledad, you have to advise her, Gorda said as if Flaca would ever listen to me.<br><br>I grab my bags and quickly walk away. Wet. I feel a chill; goose bumps emerge all over my legs and arms. I want to slam my duffel on top of the garbage bags. I'll kill whoever threw that water balloon at me. I'll make it my summer's mission. It's no wonder I avoid this place. It's always one dreadful thing after the other. If it's not my mother, it's the chaos, the noise, the higher pitch in people's voices. I need earplugs. In the eighteen years I lived with my mother, my family moved in and out of each other's apartments, trading beds as if they were playing musical chairs. They ran across the street from my grandmother's apartment to my mother's apartment, back and forth, forth and back, front doors wide open, revolving, with neighbors and family coming through from D.R. One day I thought I had my own room, the next I day I was sharing my room with three little cousins who belong to T�o So-and-so who just arrived from some campo I hadn't heard of. But Gorda told me that's all changed. Once I left the hood my mother closed house, only letting Flaca visit every once in a while. Not having access to my mother's apartment drove Gorda and my grandmother crazy. The worst thing one can do is to shut them out. It's like slapping them in the face. And I'm sure they blame me for all that.<br><br>As I approach the familiar brick-faced building that houses a courtyard filled with weeds and a dead pine tree I see a crowd. Suddenly in front of my grandmother's building, the people multiply and my grandmother is parting the crowd, carrying my mother, Olivia, with the strength of a matriarch.<br><br>I came too late. I waited too long.<br><br>The words run through my head like a mantra.<br><br>I came too late. My mother is dead.<br><br>Get out of my way.<br><br>I shove past the vecinos and vecinas, tugging, pulling, dragging myself through the crowd. Inside my grandmother's apartment the Christmas ornaments are still up in June. The heavy metal door swings open, the kitchen smells like bacalao, the apartment seems deserted, except for Gorda's room. I walk down the long dark hallway past the closets and bathroom; past my uncle Victor's diploma from refrigeration school, which he never used; a cracked mirror (Gorda believes it's one of the reasons her husband, Raful, left her); a Ziplocked bag filled with Holy Water, to counteract the broken mirror; my grandmother's collection of quincea�era dolls, (she regrettably never celebrated her fifteenth birthday); my grandfather's walker and a year's supply of adult diapers that the government sent to us compliments of Medicaid.<br><br>Can it be my mother is dead? Ever since the day my father, Manolo, died, I fantasized about finding my mother dead. I dreamed her in accidents, caught in a shoot-out, slipping in the tub and accidentally stabbing her head with the Jesus on the cross hanging in the bathroom. I thought I was switched at birth, hoping my real mother would one day appear at the door to take me away. I held on to the fact that I don't look like my mother. Maybe our lips are the same, full and pink. But my hair falls pin straight, my eyes are smaller, shaped like almonds, and my skin is fairer. My mother has the kind of face that when she smiles it makes you want to cry. A lifetime of misery, Gorda calls it. My grandmother, says it's because my mother, was born on the wrong side of things. Came out feet first, that child. But I know it has everything to do with my father. Before my father came into my mother's life, I imagine her to be more like me, with a desire to see the world, to try new things. Maybe if she had never met my father she would have been the kind of mother who would have understood why I had to leave home. Maybe I wouldn't have left in such a hurry.<br><br>I remember the day I left perfectly. The early afternoon sun poured over my mother as she leaned her chair back and switched off the overhead fluorescent lights. She had returned from work early. I was sitting at the kitchen table waiting for her.<br><br>Those damn lights give me a headache, my mother said, looking at me as if she knew I had a secret that would piss her off. I couldn't remember the last time I saw her without the deep creases between her brows. She always looked as if she had a headache; preocupada, tired, achy, with dolor.<br><br>She poured me a glass of water. I had never refused my mother. Not really. When she gave me something, I would take it to avoid arguing with her. Even if I threw it out later. But that day I wasn't thirsty. I was bloated with anxiety, fearing what will happen once I opened my mouth. I pushed the water aside. I knew it couldn't get any worse between us. Days would pass without us saying a word to each other. She would come home from work. I'd start dinner by boiling the water for the rice. And she'd cook while I did my homework, swept the apartment, threw out the trash. Then we ate together at the kitchen table passing a few words between us. I washed the dishes while she set herself up in the living room to do piecework for extra cash as she watched the novelas. For years we lived safely in our rituals. I never confronted her and no matter how our days went we went around each other like repelling magnets.<br><br>Drink it, Soledad, she said looking at me as if I was three years old.<br><br>I ignored her, looking away.<br><br>My mother poured me another glass of water and pushed the glass to the edge of the table without taking her eyes off me. The glass was clear, skinny and long; the sun reflected off the rim. The church bells rang. My fingers were filled with hangnails, more painful than paper cuts. My mother's hands were smooth, cuticles pushed back, nails painted a dark pink.<br><br>Drink it, she said again.<br><br>She poured another glass of water and another. The glasses stood next to each other like soldiers on a front line. I wouldn't drink from them. My mother got up and lost herself in the living room closet. I wanted the closet to swallow my mother, lock her up into oblivion. But she returned to the kitchen with boxes filled with old drinking glasses. She poured water into each glass, one by one.<br><br>Co�o maldita ni�a! Why won't you drink it? Why won't you take a glass of water from me, Soledad?<br><br>I tried not to look at her. My heart was pounding, my throat ached from holding back any sign of emotion. And every time I saw her I lost my conviction.<br><br>What's wrong with you?<br><br>My mother kept yelling at me as I touched the rims of the glass with my fingertips. I had never seen her fight me like this before. She must've known I was leaving. The glasses howled like hungry dogs as my sweaty hands caressed the rims. One by one I smoothed my fingertips over the water-filled glasses and they started to sing, drowning out my mother's scream.<br><br>Drink the maldita water, she begged. A glass of water, that's all, Soledad. Can't you see, I'm trying to do something nice for you? When are you going to forgive me? When?<br><br>The music from the glasses reached soprano highs that cut through the soft news radio reporting that another kid got shot from a stray bullet not too far from us.<br><br>Co�o! Listen to me, Soledad!<br><br>She swept the glasses off the table with her arms, flinging them up into the air. I hunched over and covered my eyes. Glass ricocheted off my ears. I had to remind myself that I had al...</p><h2>Russian</h2><p><p><em>Russian: From Intermediate to Advanced is</em> a vibrant and modern course designed to help students achieve advanced proficiency in Russian.

This book is an excellent introduction to the mathematics underlying the theory.<br>Designed for upper-level undergraduates and first-year graduate students, the book treats three major areas: analysis of channel models and proof of coding theorems (chapters 3, 7, and 8); study of specific coding systems (chapters 2, 4, and 5); and study of statistical properties of information sources (chapter 6). Among the topics covered are noiseless coding, the discrete memoryless channel, effort correcting codes, information sources, channels with memory, and continuous channels.<br>The author has tried to keep the prerequisites to a minimum. However, students should have a knowledge of basic probability theory. Some measure and Hilbert space theory is helpful as well for the last two sections of chapter 8, which treat time-continuous channels. An appendix summarizes the Hilbert space background and the results from the theory of stochastic processes necessary for these sections. The appendix is not self-contained but will serve to pinpoint some of the specific equipment needed for the analysis of time-continuous channels.<br>In addition to historic notes at the end of each chapter indicating the origin of some of the results, the author has also included 60 problems with detailed solutions, making the book especially valuable for independent study.</p><p>Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of Illinois, Robert Ash is the author of three other Dover books: <i>Basic Abstract Algebra, Basic Probability Theory,</i> and <i>Complex Variables</i> <i>and</i> <i>Information Theory.</i></p><h2>A Short History of the French Revolution</h2><p><p><em>A Short History of the French Revolution</em> is an up-to-date survey of the French Revolution and Napoleonic era that introduces readers to the origins and events of this turbulent period in French history, and historians&#x2019; interpretations of these events.</p> <p>The book covers all aspects of the Revolution, including the political, social, and cultural origins of the Revolution, and its causes, events, and aftermath, to provide readers with a full, and yet concise, overview of the Revolution that helps them easily understand the key elements of the subject.

Wachtel is widely regarded as the leading advocate for integrative thinking in personality theory and the theory and practice of psychotherapy. He is a contributor to cutting edge thought in the realm of relational psychoanalysis and to highlighting the ways in which the relational point of view provides especially fertile ground for integrating psychoanalytic insights with the ideas and methods of other theoretical and therapeutic orientations. </p> <p>In this book, Wachtel extends his integration of psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral, systemic, and experiential viewpoints to examine closely the nature of the inner world of subjectivity, its relation to the transactional world of daily life experiences, and the impact on both the larger social and cultural forces that both shape and are shaped by individual experience. Here, he discusses in a uniquely comprehensive fashiong the subtleties of the clinical interaction, the findings of systematic research, and the role of social, economic, and historical forces in our lives. The chapters in this book help to transcend the tunnel vision that can lead therapists of different orientations to ignore the important discoveries and innovations from competing approaches. </p> <p>Explicating the pervasive role of vicious circles and self-fulfilling prophecies in our lives, <em>Cyclical Psychodynamics and the Contextual Self</em> shows how deeply intertwined the subjective, the intersubjective, and the cultural realms are, and points to new pathways to therapeutic and social change. Both a theoretical tour de force and an immensely practical guide to clinical practice, this book will be essential reading for psychoanalysts, psychotherapists and students of human behavior of all backgrounds and theoretical orientations.</p></p><p><p><strong>Paul L.

I would certainly commend this as an important book that deserves to be widely studied in all integrative training."- Colin Feltham, Emeritus Professor of Critical Counselling Studies at Sheffield Hallam University for <em>Therapy Today</em></p> <p>"For nearly four decades Paul Wachtel has been one of the great integrative thinkers in the field of psychotherapy. In Cyclical Psychodynamics and the Contextual Self he has really outdone himself! Wachtel applies his cyclical psychodynamic perspective breathtakingly to a wide range of clinically central issues, including the importance of the larger social and cultural context.<b> </b>A must read!" - Robert D. Stolorow, Ph.D., author of World, Affectivity, Trauma: Heidegger and Post-Cartesian Psychoanalysis<b> </b>(Routledge, 2011)<br> <br>"Wachtel has once again produced a mighty work of astonishing brilliance and enduring value. Cyclical Psychodynamics and the Contextual Self is a rich and ambitious contemplation on the contemporary debates in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis by a pioneering clinician, a teacher and thinker with sparkling erudition, and a gifted writer. He examines our clinical beliefs and practices with a keen eye, an attuned ear, and a humane heart. His perceptive critiques on the world of society and culture are dispatches from the trenches.

Orfanos, Ph.D., ABPP, Clinic Director, New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis<br><br>"Paul Wachtel&#x2019;s cyclical psychodynamic theory may be the most important integrative theory of psychotherapy, bringing together a dizzying array of diverse literatures. Wachtel&#x2019;s range is astonishing,<b> </b>but he doesn&#x2019;t stop with mere comprehension. Even more interesting and significant than Wachtel&#x2019;s grasp is his capacity to bring all these theories into meaningful relation with one another. - Donnel B. Stern, Ph.D., William Alanson White Institute; NYU Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy</p> <p>"Paul Wachtel is in the vanguard of a group of seminal thinkers who are shaping what might be seen as the entrance of psychoanalysis into its "relational era." This book makes it even clearer why Wachtel's integrative theory of cyclical psychodynamics is acknowledged within and beyond the field of psychoanalysis as such a unique and powerful force in the ongoing evolution of personality theory and psychotherapy.Wachtel has written both a theoretical tour de force and an immensely practical guide to clinical practice. "&#x2013; Philip Bromberg, author The Shadow of the Tsunami: and the Growth of the Relational Mind (Routledge, 2011) </p> <p></p> <p>"How an integrationist approach relates to clinical work is masterfully demonstrated by Paul Wachtel in his brilliant new book. Wachtel writes in an engaging and accessible style and offers numerous clinical examples of the relational processes that influence the perpetuation of suboptimal patterns in our daily lives, as well as the vicious circles that characterize social phenomena, such as race relations. It is an outstanding contribution to the psychoanalytic field and one that I unreservedly recommend to novice and experienced clinicians alike." - Paul Renn, author, The Silent Past and the Invisible Present: Memory, Trauma, and Representation in Psychotherapy (Routledge, 2012)</p></p><h2>Color Atlas of Veterinary Histology</h2><p>Designed to provide students with a foundation in understanding and interpreting histologic and cytologic preparations, <i>Color Atlas of Veterinary Histology</i> is a practical benchside reference focusing on the normal histology of eight common domestic species.

Fundamental concepts and mathematics are presented prior to their use, physical interpretations of the terms in equations are given, sample data are shown, examples are solved, and exercises are included.</p> <p>The work should also be considered as a major reference and as a review of the literature, since it includes tables of parameterizatlons, procedures, filed experiments, useful constants, and graphs of various phenomena under a variety of conditions.

It argues that such a study must be interdisciplinary, locating emerging Christianities in the social practices and <em>mentalites</em> of contemporary Judaism and the early Roman empire. This can, therefore, equally be read as a study of the operation of <em>pistis/fides</em> in the world of the early Roman principate, taking one small but relatively well-attested cult as a case study in how micro-societies within that world could treat it distinctively. <br><br>Drawing on recent work in sociology and economics, the book traces the varying shapes taken by <em>pistis/fides</em> in Greek and Roman human and divine-human relationships: whom or what is represented as easy or difficult to trust or believe in; where pistis/fides is "deferred" and "reified" in practices such as oaths and proofs; how <em>pistis/fides</em> is related to fear, doubt and scepticism; and which foundations of <em>pistis/fides</em> are treated as more or less secure. <br><br>The book then traces the evolution of representations of human and divine-human <em>pistis</em> in the Septuagint, before turning to <em>pistis/pisteuein</em> in New Testament writings and their role in the development of early Christologies (incorporating a new interpretation of <em>pistis Christou</em>) and ecclesiologies. It argues for the integration of the study of <em>pistis/pisteuein</em> with that of New Testament ethics. It explores the interiority of Graeco-Roman and early Christian <em>pistis/fides</em>. Finally, it discusses eschatological <em>pistis</em> and the shape of the divine-human community in the eschatological kingdom.<br></p><p><br><strong>Teresa Morgan</strong> is Professor of Graeco-Roman History in the Faculty of Classics, Oxford University, and Nancy Bissell Turpin Fellow and Tutor in Ancient History at Oriel College.

Moving beyond its origins within the criminal justice arena, restorative justice is now being applied in schools, homes and the workplace. <p> The restorative justice approach challenges the idea that state punishment is the best method of achieving justice. This "restorative" alternative strives to directly address the needs of all persons affected by a crime or a harm, often by bringing together victims, offenders and community members in some form of structured mediation or dialogue. </p><p> The distinguished contributors to this book are all long-term advocates and practitioners of restorative justice from North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand and South Africa. The 31 chapters confront the key threats to the integrity and effectiveness of the emerging international restorative justice movement: (1) cooptation or diversion from its core mission, and the possibility that reforms may cause unintended consequences; (2) being relegated primarily to "minor" crimes or conflicts, so that it has minimal impact on the overall system or justice; and (3) inherent flaws that undermine its effectiveness, such as failure to address social problems that breed conflicts, and methods skewed by cultural or gender biases.</p></p><p>Howard Zehr is one of the founders of the restorative justice field, having directed the first victim offender reconciliation program (VORP) in the U.S. He is a Professor of Restorative Justice and co-director of the graduate Conflict Transformation Program at Eastern Mennonite University (EMU) in Virginia.

Taking a unique, all-encompassing approach that minimizes complex legalese to focus on easy-to-understand, effective asset-shielding practices and techniques, this timely book discusses:</p><ul><li>The goals of asset protection, along with steps for implementing an effective asset protection program</li><li>Traditional as well as new techniques--what they are, how they work, when and how to use them</li><li>The vital relationship between asset protection and financial planning, and how to design one umbrella program to address both</li></ul><p><i>Asset Protection </i>delivers a welcome dose of common sense and legitimacy to a field top-heavy with gimmickry and dishonesty. Written by two of today's top legal asset protection experts, it provides you with frank, pull-no-punches details on how to do everything under the law to shield assets from harm in an unpredictable and financially perilous world.</p><p>For professionals, business owners, and high net worth individuals, the danger in leaving assets vulnerable to the whims of courts and claimants is higher today than at any time in the past. And while seminar speakers often refer to "bulletproof" asset protection strategies, experienced asset protection planners know that no program or method exists that is effective in every situation--because as soon as a strategy is proven effective the attempts to undermine it will begin in earnest.</p><p><i>Asset Protection </i>is today's most level-headed and technique-based look at how asset protection planning should be approached, both by the finance practitioner and the individual. It presents tools that have worked while warning against means that are inappropriate or even perilous, and provides guidelines for developing effective strategies that will work in both macro (broad) and micro (specific) situations.</p><p>Written by two of today's most experienced and authoritative asset protection attorneys, this results-driven book provides a detailed, objective look at all vital aspects of the asset protection picture:</p><ul><li><b>Trusts</b>--What they are, what they aren't, which to implement, and when </li><li><b>Bankruptcy law --</b>Including pre<b>-</b>bankruptcy planning tactics </li><li><b>Fraudulent transfers--</b>And the confusion underlying the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (UFTA)</li><li><b>Offshore planning--</b>How to make it financially effective, tax-compliant, and judicious</li><li><b>Asset exemption options</b>--And the limits of exempt asset status </li></ul><p>In addition, <i>Asset Protection </i>also goes beyond other books of its type to explore the issue of morality in asset protection, and how actions that are seemingly right under the law can still lead to defeat in the courtroom. It provides different scenarios to illustrate how moral dilemmas can impact judges and juries, and discusses how to address these situations--or, better yet, keep them from ever reaching the courtroom.</p><p>The future of asset protection is being written even as you read these words. Get the inside story on strategies for shielding assets both today and in the future, from everything from lawsuits and the IRS to creditors and even outright scams, in the comprehensive and indispensable <i>Asset Protection</i>. </p></p><h2>The Emotionally Intelligent Investor: How self-awareness, empathy and intuition drive performance</h2><p>The Emotionally Intelligent Investor challenges several long-held assumptions and beliefs, by asserting that a good investment approach starts with introspection. Too many investment gurus tell you to emulate their techniques despite the fact that you may have very different personality traits, motivations and biases. Would Shaquille O&#x2019;Neal tell a short basketball player to play like him? This book provides a unique template for self-reflection and a framework for developing an investment approach that works best with who you are.Whereas the consensus opinion is that investing success comes from blocking out emotions and making purely rational decisions, the best money managers actually use their feelings. They actively sense what others in the market are thinking, and they employ gut instincts when making decisions. Nevertheless, virtually all investing text books neglect to mention how to best cultivate and utilize empathetic and intuitive realizations.In this book you will learn a process for developing an investing advantage by putting yourself in someone else&#x2019;s shoes. You will also discover how a stock chart is a great tool for understanding what the current holders of a security may be feeling, and you will appreciate why technical analysis works. This book demystifies intuition with respect to investing and provides a method for building and safely harnessing helpful gut instincts. Traditional security analysis is vital, but in this book you will learn why superior returns primarily depend on self-awareness, empathy and intuition. The book is complete with examples and recommendations that illuminate a path towards reaching full investing potential.</p><p>Read my blog and sample chapter 1 at theemotionallyintelligentinvestor.com/?page_id=44Ravee Mehta spent over 11 years working at two multibillion dollar funds: Karsch Capital and Soros Fund Managment.

Traditional Chinese medicine incorporates the ebbs and flows of time into achieving and maintaining good health. The cycle of four seasons is a complete circulation and the same is true of the 24-hour day. Understanding this kind of "body clock" is what <i>The Body Clock Guide</i> is all about, regardless of whether or not you are a practitioner of TCM.<br><br>In ancient China, a day was divided into 12 two-hour periods. In each two-hour period there is a different channel or collateral with vital energy "on duty." This book uses descriptive illustrations and texts to clearly explain how to utilize the theories of collaterals and channels, including:<ul><li>How to read signals from your body</li><li>Prompts for the schedule of daily life</li><li>Tips for choosing appropriate beverages and food</li><li>Simple ways of massaging acupuncture points</li></ul><br>By establishing habits that conform to the rhythm of life, you will see notable and long-lasting effects.

With populations under 500, these charming and unique locations dot the entire state&#x2015;from Lake Seneca in the Northwest corner to Neville, bordering the Ohio River and the state of Kentucky. <i>Little Ohio</i> even ventures into Lake Erie, telling the story of Put-in-Bay. </p><p> The selected locations help readers to appreciate the broader history of small-town life in Ohio. Yet each featured town boasts a distinct narrative, as unique as the citizens who call these places home. Some villages offer hundreds of years of history, such as Tarlton, laid out before Ohio had even gained statehood. Others were built with more expedience, such as Yankee Lake, a town that was incorporated simply so its founder could host dances on Sundays without breaking state law. </p><p>With full-color photographs, fun facts, and fascinating details about every locale, it&#x2019;s almost as if you&#x2019;re walking down Main Street, waving hello to folks who know you by name. These residents are innovators, hard workers, and&#x2015;most of all&#x2015;good neighbors. They&#x2019;re people who have piled into small school houses to wait out roaring flood waters, rebuilt after disastrous fires took their homes, and captured bandits straight out of the Wild West. </p><p><i>Little Ohio</i>, written by lifelong resident Karen Robertson, is for anyone who grew up in a small town and for everyone who takes pride in being called an Ohioan. It&#x2019;s one book with one hundred places to love.</p></p><p><p><b>Karen Robertson</b> is proud to have been born and raised just outside the historic city of Cleveland, Ohio. Trading in the shores of Lake Erie for the banks of the Olentangy, Karen earned her Master&#x2019;s degree in Public History from the Ohio State University in 2015. She currently works as the Assistant Curator of Manuscripts at the Ohio History Connection, where she enjoys sharing the stories of Ohio's amazing history each day. When she isn't reading and writing about the past, Karen enjoys diving into a new board game with her husband, Jake, lacing up her tennis shoes for a run, or exploring the depths of her Netflix queue.</p><p><b>A Rural Lifestyle</b> </p><p>Jacksonburg, Ohio, currently holds the title of smallest incorporated village in the state, and it has for quite some time. At its height the village held 302 people, but by 1900 this number had fallen to 77, and by 2000 the population figures were around 67. However these numbers don&#x2019;t necessarily indicate a trend. During the 1950s, the Jacksonburg population hit a spike at 114 residents. While Jacksonburg is mostly populated by descendants of citizens long past, the village also holds a draw for the occasional new residents, looking for a rural way of life. Even as some residents leave, the population is maintained by this interest in the quiet, intimate lifestyle Jacksonburg provides. </p><p>However, Jacksonburg residents, interviewed often by local and national media about their place atop the smallest village list, fear the encroachment of new residents. They have seen development change their neighbors and they wish to keep control over their own fate. Very few people ever run for office in Jacksonburg, and council seats are normally filled by write-ins. However, Jacksonburg in not ready to give up its politically independent status. As Mayor Michael Sword once told the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i>, &#x201c;We want to keep the town&#x2019;s identity.&#x201d; Sword has been mayor since 1980. </p><p>Even those new residents who find a home in the rural Jacksonburg quickly fall into the fear of development common in this village. One woman who moved from the larger Hamilton to Jacksonburg during the 1990s, eagerly told the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i> after only eight years as a resident, &#x201c;It's great, but I don't want us to get too overpopulated.&#x201d; Luckily for Jacksonburg&#x2019;s residents, almost the entire village remains zoned A-1 by Wayne Township. Because of this, homes can only be built on two-acre plots, limiting the amount of development that can encroach upon this rural way of life. </p><p><b>From Jacksonburg to Columbus: A Governor Is Born</b> </p><p>The best known citizen of Jacksonburg was James Middleton Cox, Ohio&#x2019;s 46th and 48th Governor. Cox was a lifelong Democrat, writing in his memoir that &#x201c;there must have been some Democrats in the vicinity&#x201d; when Jacksonburg was named, due to its taking of the name of President Andrew Jackson. Cox also served in the House of Representatives, and, in 1920, he ran against fellow Ohioan Warren G. Harding for President of the United States. None other than Franklin Roosevelt served as Cox&#x2019;s running mate. In fact, it was quite a star-studded campaign. Of the four men on the ticket (Cox with running mate Roosevelt and Harding with running mate Calvin Coolidge), only Cox would never make it to the Oval Office. </p><p>James Middleton Cox was born in Jacksonburg in 1870. Both of his parents had also grown up in the small village. Like many citizens of Jacksonburg, Cox maintained his grandfather&#x2019;s family home well into his adulthood. Cox worked hard as a young boy on his parents&#x2019; farm and also took on salaried positions as a janitor at his school and a sexton at his church by the age of ten. Despite the hard work, Cox maintained many positive memories of his childhood, including barefoot season with &#x201c;stone bruises,&#x201d; maple sugar season, trips to Elk Creek for baptisms, McGuffey Reader&#x2019;s from the nearby city of Oxford, and cold Sundays at church services hoping the wood fire would burn warmer. </p><p>As Cox describes it, he just happened to be in the Butler County Seat of Hamilton one day at the age of seventeen, so he took the local teacher&#x2019;s examination. Surprised, he earned a two-year certificate, and Cox began teaching while delivering newspapers for his brother-in-law on Saturdays. Cox quickly switched gears and began working at the newspaper full-time, because, as he wrote, &#x201c;printer&#x2019;s ink had moved in my blood.&#x201d; Beginning with the purchase of the <i>Dayton Evening News</i> in 1898, Cox built a media company that still provides daily news for much of Ohio&#x2019;s Miami Valley. </p><p>Cox left a mark on the entire state of Ohio during his time as governor, but he also left a very personal mark on his hometown of Jacksonburg. A religious man since his childhood, Cox helped the Jacksonburg United Methodist Church build a new sanctuary in 1924, replacing the building where Cox had spent many a cold Sunday as a child. Based upon a gothic-style building Cox had seen in England, the building is still in use by the church today. </p><p><b>Fifty Stage Coaches Each Night</b> </p><p>Jacksonburg, set upon a spot of high ground in Butler County, was first laid out in February 1816. The village quickly boomed, becoming an important stage coach station on the path between Darke and Preble counties and the city of Cincinnati. Upwards of fifty stage coaches could be found at any given night outside Jacksonburg&#x2019;s two hotels in the early 19th century. The town grew to accommodate its boom, even at one point providing a home to four tailors. Technology quickly changed, and canals and railroads ruled the transportation industry. By the late 1800s, Jacksonburg&#x2019;s short boom had come to a quick end. The village transitioned into the quiet, rural hometown that it is known as today. </p><p><b>An Impromtu School Reunion</b> </p><p>Because Jacksonburg is so small, almost everyone in town can lay claim to a piece of the village&#x2019;s history. In 2013, upon the demolition of the Wayne School, a handful of former students showed up outside the construction gates to share memories. A construction worker unexpectedly found a time capsule buried by students almost one hundred years earlier, in 1914. When the time capsule was opened and photographs found inside, one man on site was able to immediately exclaim, &#x201c;Hey that&#x2019;s my grandfather!&#x201d; </p><p>Unfortunately former students also shared a few sad memories of their time at Wayne School. In 1977, just over the Ohio River past Cincinnati, a deadly fire occurred at the Beverly Hills Supper Club on Memorial Day Weekend. Thirteen of Jacksonburg&#x2019;s residents perished in this fire, including an entire third of the Wayne School staff. Former students reminiscing around the construction site in 2013 recalled the impact these men and women had made on their lives.</p></p><h2>Robert Kuok A Memoir</h2><p><p>Robert Kuok is one of the most highly respected businessmen in Asia.

Henry Awards</b><i>. </i>In her new collection, she enhances her reputation as a true artist of the form.<br><br>Here are characters confronted with tragedy, perplexed by emotions, and challenged to endure whatever modern life may have in store. A loving mother accompanies her daughter in her journey to become a man, and discovers a new, hopeful love. A stepmother and stepson meet again after fifteen years and a devastating mistake, and rediscover their familial affection for each other. And in "The Story," a widow bent on seducing another woman's husband constructs and deconstructs her story until she has "made the best and happiest ending" possible "in this world."</p><p>It was Henry James who first claimed the imagination of disaster, but in Amy Bloom's stunning second collection, she appears to have inherited the mantle. Most of the characters in <i>A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You</i> are pursued by at least one of the biological furies: cancer, miscarriage, Parkinson's disease. And even those with their health intact tend to be sick at heart, having run the gantlet of family life and suffered what the military men like to call friendly fire. Yet the effect of these brilliant stories is anything but dreary. Instead they produce an odd sense of elation--Bloom somehow persuades us that her characters will continue under their own steam long after we've closed the book, and she alternates hope and hopelessness in exactly the right, recognizable proportions.<p> Take the title story, in which a middle-aged mother is determined to see her daughter through the rigors of a sex-change operation. Jane puts up a good front, almost but not quite earning the title of Transsexual Mom of the Year, and supports her "handsome boy-girl" every step of the way. Yet the strain shows. And when she meets a supernaturally nice man, she can't quite credit her good fortune--even his appearance at her door with an armload of flowers touches off a fresh round of ambivalence: </p><blockquote> And standing on the little porch of the condo, barely enough room for two medium-size people and forty-eight roses, Jane sees that she has taken her place in the long and honorable line of fools for love: Don Quixote and Hermia and Oscar Wilde and Joe E. Brown, crowing with delight, clutching his straw boater and Jack Lemmon as the speedboat carries them off into a cockeyed and irresistible future. </blockquote> The inclusion of <i>Some Like It Hot</i>'s Joe E. Brown, who's gotten both more and less than he bargained for in his cross-dressing sweetheart, is a typically marvelous touch. And lest we think that Bloom has weighted the scales too heavily in favor of disillusion, Jane's new lover gets in the last word, citing the South Carolina state motto: "<i>Dum spiro, spero</i>.... While I breathe, I hope." Just keep breathing, the reader wants to say.<p> "Stars at Elbow and Foot" and "Rowing to Eden" are no less effective in their mingling of tragedy and sublime trivia. In two other stories, Bloom revives the Sampson clan, which she first introduced in <i>Come to Me</i>, and beautifully extends her mini-epic of mixed-race life without a grain of namby-pamby PC hesitation. And last but not least, there's "The Story," a tricky number in which Bloom seems to shoot to hell her own reputation for Chekhovian decency. Here we have a narrator who lies and dissembles, destroys her rival, and lives to tell the (metafictional) tale: "Even now I regard her destruction as a very good thing, and that undermines the necessary fictive texture of deep ambiguity, the roiling ambivalence that might give tension to the narrator's affection." In the end, though, Bloom is simply too gifted a writer to banish all seven types of ambiguity from her work. She understands that we are hopelessly divided creatures and cuts us the necessary, unsentimental slack. Or to put it another way, she forgives all--but forgets nothing. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>&#x201c;Exotic intimacies color [these] sharply wrought stories....

He lives with his family in Brooklyn, New York.</p>PreS-Gr 3-A gorgeously illustrated, simply told, and emotionally complex story about anger and grief. When a friendless, grumpy goat arrives at Sunny Acres, the other animals don't know why he is so ornery and they try to befriend him. However, rebukes come swift and hard. Goat kicks, scowls, and stares at the ground. It is only when he finds a lone dandelion on a hill-painted full page, as majestically as a Van Gogh sunflower-that his anger starts to unravel. Meanwhile, Cow, the sheep, and the pigs are undeterred by his rudeness, demonstrating their power of perseverance and forgiveness, and he begins to accept their invitations. However, one fateful day Goat watches helplessly as his beloved flower blows away. Despondent and in a state of mourning, he is cared for by his friends, each in their own way. Understated writing with superb pacing and luminous and warm oil paintings using a vibrant brushwork style result in a story to ponder and pore over. The simple truths of the world's beauty and friends' loyalty are healing. Sharon Dennis Wyeth's Something Beautiful (Random, 1998), Philip C.

His first fighter was the famed Spitfire, hero of the Battle of Britain. By 1943, however, it was obsolescent and did not match up well against the first-line German Messerschmitts and Focke-Wulfs. Yet Loving survived 101 combat missions flying the Spitfire. In the spring of 1944, Loving&#x2019;s 31st Fighter Group started flying P-51 Mustangs and was transferred to the new Fifteenth Air Force to escort heavy-bomber formations on long-range strategic strikes across southern Europe, including southeastern Germany. In the flak-filled skies over Ploesti, Vienna, Bucharest, Munich, and Stuttgart, where a number of the war&#x2019;s fiercest air battles took place, Lieutenant Loving flew head-to-head against some of the Luftwaffe&#x2019;s top fighter aces.<br><br>By the time George Loving completed his 151st, and final, combat mission on August 21, 1944, he had risen from a lowly second lieutenant and untested wingman to captain, group leader, and Mustang ace. Loving&#x2019;s gripping account captures the savage action he experienced in all its intensity.</p><p>A career air force officer with 37 years&#x2019; service, <b>Lt. General George G. Loving Jr</b>. served as a fighter pilot in World War II and qualified as a fighter ace. During the Korean War, he commanded a fighter-bomber squadron and fought in five major campaigns. In subsequent years, Loving served as a test pilot; Air Command and Staff College instructor; adviser to the Republic of China&#x2019;s air force; and staff officer in Headquarters, Tactical Air Command, and on the Air Staff in Washington. Following his promotion to brigadier general in 1970, he served as commandant, Air Command and Staff College. This was followed by advancement to major general in 1973 and assignment as the air force&#x2019;s director of plans. In 1975, representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he joined the United States delegation in Vienna as the senior United States military representative at the NATO&#x2013;Warsaw Pact arms limitation negotiations. Later that same year, as a lieutenant general, he assumed command of the Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force (NATO) with headquarters in Izmir, Turkey. His final active duty assignments were as commander, United States Forces, Japan, and commander, Fifth Air Force, with headquarters at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo. A command pilot, his decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, and Distinguish Flying Cross, as well as a number of other U.S. and foreign decorations.1<br><br>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor of December 7, 1941, dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. Pacific Fleet, destroying four of its eight battleships and heavily damaging the other four, together with three cruisers, three destroyers, and several support vessels. Also, ninety-two Navy aircraft were destroyed, and at nearby Hickam Field, ninety-four Army Air Corps aircraft were lost. Three days later, two British battleships, HMS Prince of Wales and Repulse, dispatched to defend Singapore, were sunk by Japanese aircraft off the Malay coast, and within weeks still more Allied naval forces in the Pacific were sunk off Java. The situation worsened as the Japanese in quick succession conquered Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, and Burma and landed in New Guinea, thus posing a threat to Australia. Also, the islands of the Marianas (except Guam) were captured by the Japanese, and in June 1942 Japanese forces occupied Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands near Alaska. Good news was scarce, although in April 1942 a force of sixteen B-25 bombers launched from the USS Hornet and led by Lt. Col. James Doolittle bombed Tokyo. This caused little physical damage, but struck an important psychological blow that put the Japanese on notice of what the future held for them. In May Allied forces prevailed in the Battle of the Coral Sea, frustrating a possible Japanese invasion of eastern New Guinea, and in June a Japanese attack on Midway Island was turned back. By December 1941, German forces controlled virtually all of Europe, had occupied most of the Ukraine, and were within twenty miles of Moscow. By mid-1942, the Germans had pushed deep into the Soviet Union and were on the road to Stalingrad, on the Volga River.<br>The forty-five newly appointed aviation cadets who boarded the train at Richmond's Broad Street Station on June 10, 1942, were in high spirits, pleased after so many weeks of waiting to finally be on the move. Soon after boarding I discovered that other contingents of cadets had come aboard in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., and as we proceeded south still others joined us in Raleigh and Columbia, with the total reaching over 400 by the time the last group boarded in Atlanta. Our destination was Maxwell Army Air Field at Montgomery, Alabama.<br><br>The train's coaches were worn and soiled from years of hard use. Cinders and soot from the coal-fired locomotive swept in through the windows and doors, and the temperature rose steadily as we rolled toward Alabama. It was an uncomfortable trip, but there was little complaining. The changing scenery and endless talk and speculation about our immediate future occupied the hours, and in the process I got to know many of the cadets in my car. Included were two from Lynchburg-Edwin J. White Jr., a casual acquaintance, and John D. Ripley, whom I hadn't met before. Both were as surprised to see me as I was to see them. Ironically, except for our first ten days together at Maxwell Field, I never served again with either of them and it was not until after the war that we saw each other again.<br><br>It began as the train began moving out of Richmond-Rebels! Yankees!-and it continued all through our cadet training. It started when a cadet from New York referred to my group of Virginians as "Rebels" and then someone in my coach called attention to the "Yankees" in the car up ahead. It was all very friendly, but I hadn't expected that the characterizations of the Civil War, ended seventy-seven years earlier, would take hold so readily. The sharp differences in regional speech were what set it all in motion. Not many of us had traveled widely, and few of the Southerners had heard a real, live New Yorker talk, much less a Bostonian. For most of the cadets from those areas, this was the first personal exposure to the Southern drawl. So there was a tendency to attach a label of Rebel or Yankee, not as an expression of animosity but rather as a good-natured, friendly way of identifying those strange-sounding other fellows from above or below the Mason-Dixon Line. Over the months that followed, there were many comments about Civil War battles lost by one side or the other and about Sherman's march through Georgia. I don't know how the Northerners reacted to "Yankee," but I got the feeling that the Southerners were rather pleased with their "Rebel" label. While speech was the most obvious dissimilarity, there were also differences in the cultural, economic, and education backgrounds of the cadets, as well as in age, which ranged from eighteen to twenty-six and a half. But despite all these differences, we all got along well.<br><br>Army trucks transported the group from the Montgomery railway station to Maxwell Field and deposited us on the roadside in front of a large group of pyramidal tents, a form of shelter I would get to know well in the months ahead. As the newest arrivals, we ended up under canvas because the base was jammed with cadets. After a roll call and brief welcome, we were shown to a tent and instructed to pick a cot and then gather up all our civilian clothes and assemble outside. As we marched off to the quartermaster warehouse, we were a ragtag group-more a mob than a military formation-awkward in responding to marching orders, many out of step, and no two dressed alike. All that would soon change. After we stripped to the skin and placed our civilian clothes, shoes and socks included, in a bag with an attached tag addressed to home, we were issued cadet uniforms, summer and winter, together with underwear, handkerchiefs, shoes, boots, socks, raincoat, mackinaw, and a duffel bag to carry whatever wasn't being worn. As we were handed the various items of clothing, starting with underwear, we redressed, and by the time we reached the end of the line we were fully clothed as aviation cadets. Though a bit rumpled and not sure how to wear our caps, we felt for the first time a part of the army. After dropping off the bag of newly issued clothing in our tent, we were marched to the barber shop for a quick five-minute scalping. Marching, I soon discovered, was a way of life for cadets; we didn't walk anywhere as individuals but marched in formation, with the commander counting cadence. Starting on our second day, we were introduced to cadence marching songs, and often sang them as we marched about the base.<br><br>Our orders assigned us to the Army Air Forces Classification Center where we were to undergo the screening and classification tests that would determine our future. The burning question for all of us was whether we would be classified to enter pilot, bombardier, or navigator training. A few wanted navigator or bombardier training, but the vast majority wanted to be pilots. We had completed what we thought was a thorough physical examination before being accepted as aviation cadets, but apparently the army wasn't satisfied. We were examined again from tip to toe and, in addition, underwent a psychiatric evaluation. The physical exam wasn't of particular concern to me, but I got a little tense when asked to interpret a bunch of mysterious ink blots and answer strange questions posed by a four-eyed MD.<br><br>My real concern was the aptitude tests, designed, I was told, to assess our coordination and our ability to quickly and accurately adjust to constantly changing stimuli-whatever that meant. Also, there would be tests to evaluate judgment and resourcefulness in solving practical problems, measure our ability to read and understand technical information, and assess our general knowledge of mathematics and mechanical principles. Based on reports by cadets who had taken the examinations, I decided that the psychomotor tests were the most critical, or at least they appeared to be the most challenging. They involved a host of electromechanical devices (some akin to pinball machines), while others resembled an aircraft cockpit with a control stick and rudder controls. All had blinking lights and buzzers. The whole examination process took about a week to complete, and at the end, when the results were posted on the bulletin board, we all rushed to see how we had fared. I was ecstatic to be among those selected for pilot training. For me, this represented a successfully negotiated hurdle of the many I would encounter in my quest to be a fighter pilot. Ed White, much to his disappointment, was on the bombardier training list, while John Ripley qualified for pilot training.<br><br>For those selected for pilot training, the first phase of the nine-month training program took place at the Pre-Flight School (Pilot) on Maxwell Field and lasted ten long weeks. My group of 600 cadets was designated Class 43C, signifying that we would complete the nine-month program and be commissioned in March 1943, if we were successful.<br><br>* * *<br><br>The Pre-Flight School was a combination boot camp and officers' candidate school. The first priority, it seemed, was to instill discipline and whip us into shape physically. Concurrently, we studied the basic military skills required of commissioned officers and attended classes to refresh our understanding of some basic academic subjects.<br><br>Constructed on the site of Orville and Wilbur Wright's flying school, Maxwell Field was one of the Army Air Forces' oldest bases and home of the Air Tactical School where officers studied air tactics and strategy and learned to plan large-scale air campaigns. It was a beautiful base, and still is today, with handsome brick buildings, including a fine officers' club and spacious quarters, but other than observing these facilities from the outside, I had little time to even reflect on such things.<br><br>We were housed in wooden barracks, four to a room, with each room opening onto a screened porch that ran the length of the building. Cadets were awakened at 0600 hours by a bugle sounding reveille and assembled thirty minutes later for reports and announcements, after which we marched to the mess hall for breakfast.<br><br>Hazing was conducted by upperclassmen as a way of imbuing discipline. Upperclassmen addressed us as "Mister," usually in a sarcastic tone, and we were required to march everywhere, squaring our corners at every turn. Minor infractions invited an order to "hit a brace," a position of rigid attention with several chins showing. Mealtime didn't provide a respite from hazing. With two upperclassmen at each table, the torment continued without letup.<br><br>Some 360 hours of instruction constituted our preflight training program, of which 110 hours were devoted to basic military and officer training. Fifty-five hours were for close-order drill, interior guard, ceremonies and inspections, small-arms familiarization, and squadron administration and command; and fifty-five were given to the customs and courtesies of the service, military law, military organization, military hygiene, first aid, chemical warfare defense, citizenship, and current events.<br><br>The least popular activity was the hour a day devoted to physical conditioning. But one of the most demanding for many was the daily session, totaling 48 hours, of instruction aimed at achieving proficiency in reading Morse code, visually and aurally, at the rate of six words a minute-a requirement for successful completion of preflight training. Despite my earlier Boy Scout training in sending and receiving in Morse code, I found this a difficult subject to master. Refresher courses in physics (24 hours) and mathematics (20 hours), and classes in map reading (18 hours) and aircraft recognition (30 hours) rounded out our academic studies.<br><br>The rumor being passed around was that two years of college studies were being squeezed into ten weeks. Given the pace of instruction, I didn't find any reason to disagree with that assessment. We were given a test every day in every subject, as well as midterm and final examinations. Fifty percent of the average of the daily test grades combined with fifty percent of the average of the midterm and final examination scores produced the course grade. The passing score was 70.<br><br>Academic subjects kept us busy during half of each day, either morning or afternoon, while the physical aspects of our training occupied the other half. Study assignments were accomplished during the evening hours. Inspection of our rooms usually took place on Saturday mornings, while inspections in the ranks could occur at any point. Observed infractions of the rules (late to a formation, uniform worn incorrectly, and the like) resulted in demerits that had to be walked off in a designated area while toting a heavy World War I rifle. Guard duty was an integral part of our training, and I moaned about having to walk a post during the wee hours of the morning just as my father had described twenty-four years earlier in a letter he wrote to his mother from Camp Lee. On the other hand, despite our grumbling about the summer heat, parades had a way of lifting our spirits as we demonstrated proudly just how much we had progressed in learning to march and maneuver with precision under the leadership of our own cadet officers. These were colorful and impressive affairs with an array of flags and pennants whipping in the breeze and a band playing lively marches, while hundreds of cadets massed on the drill field and then passed in review, squadron by squadron, marching with the perfection of veterans.<br><br>The very worst time to undertake a rigorous physical conditioning program in Alabama is midsummer. We confronted this repeatedly as we turned out under the blazing sun for calisthenics and close-order drill.<br><br>Always demanding, our daily physical-conditioning sessions sometimes pressed us to the limits of our endurance, and we came to view our physical instructors as sadistic monsters who seemed to enjoy torturing us. I remember well the blistering day in August when we jogged four miles or so around the outer perimeter of Maxwell Field to within sight of our starting place, and then to our disbelief and dismay the instructor turned the group and we double-timed back the way we had come. At the end of such sessions, we were so dehydrated that a glass of swamp water would have been welcomed if that had been all that was available. However, my mind hadn't been on water but on the beverage machine located on my barracks' porch. It wasn't functioning properly, and the contents of all the bottles of soda came out frozen, which I found to be excellent for cooling down quickly.<br><br>One of the most enjoyable facets was our training on the firing range. Here we received instruction in the care and handling of the .45-caliber Colt semiautomatic pistol. Although I had had some experience with shotguns and had done a fair amount of target practice using a BB rifle, the Colt .45 was something else. It was so heavy that I didn't see how one could possibly achieve a lot of accuracy with it. Nevertheless I did surprisingly well.</p><h2>The Magic Touch : A Jewish Approach to Relationships</h2><p><p>The sense of touch is powerful: It can heal and it can hurt.

It&#x2019;s Me, Chelsea (2008), takes readers on her travels; each adventure can only be described as a total shit show. Absurdity reigns, from a safari in Africa, where the only ones getting penetrated (her favorite word) are the hundreds of baboons at the lodge, to the Bahamas, where after eight days in Africa without a bowel movement, Handler finally lets loose into an innocent kayak. The U.S. is not left unscathed, either. At most times, Handler is surrounded by her friends&#x2014;let&#x2019;s face it, she wouldn&#x2019;t survive on her own&#x2014;and Chunk, a half-German, half-Asian dog that she believes to be the reincarnation of her dead mother. As long as someone can make a decent margarita, and there&#x2019;s Xanax on hand, Handler is just fine&#x2014;although the same can&#x2019;t be said for the people she encounters. The final chapters really have nothing to do with travel and feel less connected to the rest of the book; in Handler&#x2019;s defense, she was probably drunk by this point in the writing process. But if you&#x2019;re one of the millions who enjoy Handler&#x2019;s sarcastic, self-deprecating humor (and her tendency to be pantless), then you may just pee yourself laughing as she humiliates herself from Montenegro to Telluride. Unfortunately&#x2014;really unfortunately&#x2014;photos weren&#x2019;t available at the time of review, but based on the shenanigans described, they have a ton of potential.

In the introductory scene just before the title page, the redheaded boy, tucked in bed in his darkened room, addresses the black cat curled above him, gazing through the window at the dusky world. "Good-night, Sylvie." Sylvie, it soon appears, is not ready for sleep and meows insistently until the two tiptoe through the sleeping house and out into the nighttime shadows. Gerstein's roughly sketched scenes with well-chosen detail are done on gray art paper, a fine choice for these shadowy night views. The early indoor scenes are boxed against the outer page. Heading for the open door, Sylvie hints, "It's coming...hurry." The dark outside opens fully on a spread and is soft and comfortable with shadows everywhere. "Are those shadows roses? Are those lilies and sunflowers? Where are their colors?" Soon the shadows reveal a great variety of animals that begin to echo Sylvie's hint. "It's on its way...here it comes...It's almost here." Eventually a glow appears above the trees, the shadowy animals slip away, and the world gathers color, leading to a full burst of sun. Boy and cat rush into the house to announce the beautiful day. Gerstein adds a personal note about his early childhood discomfort with the outer night world and his lifelong love of sunrise. Children will surely respond to his simple scheme, beautifully crafted with spare text and with much to enjoy in the homely views of house and yard.

Recent changes in the PC(USA) Constitution have meant fewer rules and more flexibility in governance, making it imperative that leaders understand the historical principles that guide the church. Wilton explains the Book of Order's historic principles of church order in accessible language, providing readers with a lively appreciation of the revolutionary principles that guided the Presbyterian experiment in the New World and are still the beating heart of church life today. <i>Principles of Presbyterian Polity</i> is written from the conviction that it is not enough merely to know the "what" of polity; a deep, intuitive understanding of the "why" is just as vital.

I also wanted the reader to realize the change post-modernity brought to belief in the supernatural and/or the paranormal.&nbsp; One chapter dealt with my doctoral thesis that was written to verify healings of people who had lost range of motion and/or were in chronic pain from surgeries where metal was implanted into the body. This was a study conducted on five continents involving almost 1,000 people.&nbsp; As a result of the study, the placebo effect was addressed and proven it could not account for the healings.&nbsp; In addition, I wanted to find out if there were any variables that made the probability of receiving healing more probable. I discovered there were and recorded them. In summary, the first half of the book is testimonies of healings which can be read, and many of them watched; the second half, an analysis of the causes of prejudice against the miraculous in the 16-20th centuries, and the opening up to the miraculous in the 21st century.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Dr. Randy Clark is the founder and president of Global Awakening.&nbsp; He pursued theological studies in college, eventually completing a Masters of Divinity from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.&nbsp; After years of ministry, Randy's life would drastically change in 1994 when he walked into a prayer meeting in a small storefront church near the Toronto Airport.

Brundage, whose art contemporaries include Virgil Finlay and Hannes Bok, is unique as she was the first female cover artist of the pulp era. Decades before the gothic fetish craze, Brundage's lush, provocative paintings, which frequently featured smoldering, semi-nude young women bearing whips, became a focus of acute attention and controversy. At the very peak of the notorious pulp's classic run, the magazine's appeal was due as much to Brundage's covers as to the stories inside by famous authors H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert Bloch and Conan creator, Robert E. Howard. Long before Frazetta, it was Brundage who was the very 1st Conan cover artist. The Alluring Art of Margaret Brundage is the premier book devoted to this noted artist and features all of her Weird Tales and Conan covers.<br>Authors Stephen D. Korshak and J. David Spurlock follow their seminal collaboration, The Paintings of J. Allen St. John -- Grand Master of Fantasy, with The Alluring Art of Margaret Brundage which, also features essays by noted artist Rowena, Weird Tales historian Robert Weinberg, First-Fandom member / Shasta publisher Melvin Korshak, and Men's Adventure Magazines: In Postwar America co-author George Hagenauer. THE VILLAGE VOICE said 12-11-2013: "Brundage's menaced damsels were sleek eye candy, but this book reveals politics --advocating for gender and racial equality as well as labor rights at a time when activism led to blacklisting -- that prove that the 'Queen of the Pulps' was as brave as any of her titillating heroines."</p><p>THE VILLAGE VOICE 12-11-2013: <br><br>Brundage's menaced damsels were sleek eye candy, but this book reveals politics --advocating for gender and racial equality as well as labor rights at a time when activism led to blacklisting -- that prove that the 'Queen of the Pulps' was as brave as any of her titillating heroines.

His job was to find the enmy, observe him, or kill him--all the while behind enemy lines, where success could be as dangerous as discovery.</p><p><b>Gary Linderer</b>&nbsp;is the publisher of&nbsp;<i>Behind the Lines</i>, a magazine that specializes in US military special operations. He served in Vietnam with the LRPs of the 101st Airborne Division, earning two Silver Stars, the Bronze Star with V device (for valor), the Army Commendation Medal with V device, and two Purple Hearts.Eyes Behind the Lines Prologue<br><br>I had to smile at the irony of it all as the C-130 slammed onto the runway at the Phu Bai airstrip near the imperial city of Hue. Only seven months ago, another C-130 had delivered me to this same hot, sticky, strip of tarmac situated on the coastal plain in the northern part of the Republic of Vietnam. Back then, I had been a green twenty-one-year-old, sold on the idea that I was one of American&#x2019;s finest, answering my country&#x2019;s call. I was full of piss and vinegar and ready to take on Uncle Ho and his whole Asian horde. I had volunteered for airborne infantry, advanced individual training, and Jump School in an attempt to get into Officer Candidate School; my two years of college and ROTC had not impressed the army enough to select me as a candidate for the program. However, it did impress them enough to send me halfway around the world to attend a one-year seminar in combat survival.<br><br>I had been lucky enough to be assigned to the famous &#x201c;Screaming Eagles&#x201d; of the 101st Airborne Division and had opted for &#x201c;fraternity life&#x201d; by volunteering for special operations duty with F Company, 58th Infantry (Long Range Patrol).<br><br>The army had done an excellent job of pumping all of us full of massive doses of self-confidence. Back in the States at Fort Gordon and Fort Benning, the care had hot-wired my buddies and me into believing that we were indeed &#x201c;the baddest motherfuckers in the valley.&#x201d; We developed a heightened sense of immortality and esprit that caused many of us to say a prayer each night that the war would go on long enough for us to get over there.<br><br>Some of our instructors threatened us with stories about how tough &#x201c;Charlie&#x201d; was and warned us that he would blow us away in a minute if he caught us &#x201c;half stepping&#x2019;. &#x201d; They promised that if we fell asleep on guard, we}d wake up wearing an extra smile&#x2014;one cut from ear to ear. After all, we were Airborne, and the baddest motherfuckers in the valley. Airborne didn&#x2019;t half step, and we sure as hell didn&#x2019;t sleep on guard. Mr. Charles had better watch his ass when we got to the Nam.<br><br>My first seven months in country had exposed the lie. The cadre hadn&#x2019;t been bullshitting us, and we weren&#x2019;t the baddest motherfuckers in the valley, either. The damn valley was full of bad motherfuckers. Upon our arrival, we quickly discovered that we were as green as the stiff, chafing new jungle fatigues they issued us. The months of training back in the States had been woefully inadequate for what we would experience in the Nam.<br><br>The first few weeks proved to be a twenty-four-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week cram course, &#x201c;How to Stay Alive in a Hostile Environment.&#x201d; And no training, in any amount, could truly have prepared us for the actual trials and tribulations of combat. Combat was its own finishing school. But we learned! Slowly but surely, we became jungle-hardened LRPs.<br><br>We developed the ability to perform under adverse conditions and in situations that would have destroyed lesser men. Those who couldn&#x2019;t cut it were quickly and quietly weeded out of the program and sent to other units. There was no place in the Long Range Patrol for the weak, the timid, the unmotivated. In time, our &#x201c;greenness&#x201d; had faded, just as the color had bleached from our uniforms and the rest of our gear. The dense, mountainous jungles and the constant sun/heat, sun/rain, sun/sweat, sun/dust cycle that was Vietnam had leached the parade-ground perfection out of each of us.<br><br>Humping the steep mountains of the Annamese Cordilla with hundred-pound rucksacks had increased our endurance. We learned to stalk the thick vegetation flanking the enemy&#x2019;s high-speed trails with the stealth of a panther. We learned how to wait for the enemy along those trails, and to strike with the speed and deadliness of the cobra. We made an alliance with the jungle. It soon became our friend, providing us with shelter and cover as we sought out our enemies. We conquered our fear of the darkness, and learned how to use it to conceal us from the searching eyes of the NVA. We had studied the enemy at his own game. After a while, we had become its master.<br><br>For years, our six-man teams had infiltrated silently into the enemy&#x2019;s staging areas to gather intelligence and to find him and kill him where he thought he was secure. Swift but deadly ambushes had left numerous NVA patrols no more than fly-blown heaps of carrion along the jungle trails. Many NVA couriers and VC political officers had died while moving between the lowland villages and the distant mountain sanctuaries. Ammo caches had exploded in the faces of unsuspecting NVA soldiers attempting to resupply themselves. Base camps and supply depots had been destroyed by sudden artillery barrages and well-plotted B-42 &#x201c;Arc Light&#x201d; bombing runs. Numerous troop concentrations had been destroyed in sudden assaults by Cobra gunships or airstrikes by fast-flying U.S. fighter-bombers.<br><br>The NVA knew that this death and destruction was not the result of mere chance. Someone was out there watching them! The enemy had come to fear and hate, yet respect, the &#x201c;men with the painted faces.&#x201d; We had adopted their style of war. They had always preferred to pick the time and place to engage their enemies in combat. The men of the Long Range Patrols had taken that option away from them. They were being taught the same demoralizing lesson that they had forced our soldiers to learn: death was everywhere in Vietnam. There were no havens!<br><br>A couple of weeks before I reached the &#x201c;hump,&#x201d; the midpoint in my twelve-month tour, the NVA took back their option. It was my fourteenth mission, a twelve-man &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; team recon patrol into the Roung-Roung Valley.<br><br>Sgt. Al Contreros was the overall team leader of the two combined teams. We had inserted at dusk into an elephant grass-choked ravine next to some heavy jungle. John Sours had broken his ankles on the insertion. Not wanting to compromise the team, he had played down the extent of his injury.<br><br>We moved into the jungle at dusk and located a wide, well-used high-speed trail snaking along the base of a ridgeline. We followed it east until we heard a warning shot a couple hundred meters to our front. We set up an L-shaped ambush at a bend in the road and lay back to await the dawn.<br><br>During the night enemy patrols with flashlights came looking for us. They passed within ten feet of our positions. We held our fire, not wanting to initiate the ambush with so many alerted NVA soldiers in the immediate vicinity.<br><br>At dawn, we discovered that Sours&#x2019; ankles were too swollen for him to function without help. The team leader made the decision to extract him from our original LZ and sent him down the ravine with an escort of two other LRPs. As the medevac ship lifted him out, we heard another shot up the trail from our ambush site. The sound of the helicopter extracting Sours must have made the NVA think that we had all been pulled out. The second shot was probably and &#x201c;All clear&#x201d; signal to the NVA soldiers in the area.<br><br>An hour later, ten NVA entered our kill zone and we initiated the ambush, killing nine of them. Their point man, although wounded, escaped. We checked the bodies and discovered that among the dead were four nurses and an NVA major with a dispatch case full of maps and documents. We called for a reaction force to come in and help us secure the area. We waited an hour before being informed that no reaction force was available. In addition, our helicopters were tied up in a brigade-size combat assault and would be unable to extract us for several hours.<br><br>Our position was precarious. We had stayed too long at the kill zone waiting for help that would not be arriving. We had violated one of the cardinal rules of long-range patrolling&#x2014;never remain at an ambush site without being reinforced. The team leader informed us that we were to move out immediately and attempt to find a more defensive position on higher ground.<br><br>Jim Venable, our assistant team leader, walked out into a nearby clearing to flash our position to our company commander&#x2019;s circling command&#x2014;and-control chopper. As he sighted through the hole of the signal mirror, NVA soldiers hidden in the surrounding jungle opened up on him with automatic weapon, severely wounding him in the arm, neck, and chest. The rest of the team laid down a heavy volume of fire as two other LRPs ran out and dragged the wounded point man back into the perimeter.<br><br>Thirty or forty NVA assaulted our position from the direction of the original LZ. We beat them back, killing several of them in the process. The next few hours were hell. We drove one assault after another away from our position, directing artillery and Cobra gunships against the surrounding NVA. Our ammunition was running low, when the team leader ordered us to tighten up the perimeter so that he could direct our supporting fire in closer to us. As the remainder of the team moved to consolidate their positions, a large, command-detonated claymore mine exploded to our rear, sending thousands of deadly pellets through our ranks. When the smoke cleared, four LRPs were dead, and the remainder were wounded. Only three of us were still able to defend our perimeter.<br><br>For two hours we fought desperately to stay alive. Cobra gunships crisscrossed our perimeter in a determined effort to keep the NVA from wiping out the survivors. We brought in three medevac choppers and were able to get three of the most seriously wounded out by jungle penetrator.<br><br>Just as we were about to write ourselves off, a hastily formed reaction force comprised of LRPs from our own company helicopter-assaulted into a bomb-crater a hundred meters from our position and fought its way through the surrounding NVA to our perimeter. We were saved. Laterm in the surgical center in Phu Bai, I was to find out how serious our losses had been. Sgt. Al Contreros, the team leader, Sgt. Mike Reiff, Sp4c. Art Heringhausen, and my best friend, Sp4c. Terry Clifton, had been killed. Sp4c. Frank Souza, Sp4c. Riley Cox, Sp4c. Jim Bacon, Sgt. Jim Venable, and Sp4c. Steve Czepurny had all been wounded so seriously that they were being shipped back to the States. Their tours were over. Only Sgt. John Sours, Sp4c. Billy Walkabout, and myself would return to duty after recovering from our wounds.<br><br>It was a heavy loss for F Company, one that would take months to recover from. I had lost a best friend on that hilltop, a loss that would cause me grief and anguish for years to follow. You see, it had been my fault that he was there that day.<br><br>I had witnessed another man&#x2019;s heroism that should have won him the Medal of Honor. On three separate occasions, Billy Walkabout, although wounded in the hands, had charged unarmed up to the NVA positions to retrieve an errantly dropped jungle penetrator to medevac our wounded. I had learned of my own vulnerability. Death had been at my side that day. I had accepted it. I had made peace with my maker and then, in the next instant, had begged Him to spare me. I had even made up my mind to kill the wounded and then myself, if it appeared that we would be overrun. I would not let myself or my buddies be taken prisoner. Was I heroic, self-serving, or playing God? Therese were questions I could never answer.<br><br>After four weeks of convalescence at the 6th convalescent center at Cam Ranh Bay, I had conned my doctor into sending me back to my unit early. I could not bear to goldbrick in the security of a convalescent center while my comrades were still pulling missions up in I Corps. REMF (rear-echelon motherfucker) life was not for me! They cut orders shipping me back to Bien Hoa to clear the division rear before being reassigned. There was a good chance I would be sent to another unit.<br><br>I spent a couple of days with an air force buddy from my home town at the air base at Cam Ranh Bay, then hopped a C-130 directly to Phu Bai. I decided not to report to Bien Hoa and take the chance of being shipped to another outfit. I would be good to get back. My first Christmas away from my family and fianc�e would not be spent with a bunch of strangers.</p><h2>A Beautiful Anarchy: When the Life Creative Becomes the Life Created</h2><p><i>A Beautiful Anarchy</i> is a vulnerable, honest, and insightful book about the human longing to create, whether you&#x2019;re creating a family, a business, a book, or a photograph. Your greatest creation can be an intentional life lived on your own terms. What is our life but a chance to make the greatest art of all? <p></p> If you already identify as a creative person, this book is an invitation to more intentionally explore your creative process. If you've ever said, &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not really creative,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s a call to exhume a part of yourself that desperately needs to get out and breathe. <p></p> This is an honest discussion about creativity and the obstacles that stand in your way on that journey. It&#x2019;s an invitation to consider the creative in all of us, and to recognize that your best work will always be done when you colour outside the lines and listen first to your own voice. Truly exceptional, authentic lives have never belonged to the talented or the fearless, but to those who find the courage to do their work, and to be themselves.</p><p>&#x201c;David believes, as do I, that we are made to create. Not some of us. Not just a select few. But all of us. <i>A Beautiful Anarchy</i> is a book about being free.

How we can choose to live life on our own terms, to live intentionally, and make art with our lives. My favorite idea from the book is the idea of your life as a canvas.

In these professional settings, my personal experiences with hunger, poverty, and episodic homelessness, often go undetected. I had worked hard to learn the rules and disguise my beginning in life...</i></p><p> So begins <i>Born Bright, </i>C. Nicole Mason's powerful memoir, a story of reconciliation, constrained choices and life on the other side of the tracks. Born in the 1970s in Los Angeles, California, Mason was raised by a beautiful, but volatile16-year-old single mother. Early on, she learned to navigate between an unpredictable home life and school where she excelled. </p><p>By high school, Mason was seamlessly straddling two worlds. The first, a cocoon of familiarity where street smarts, toughness and the ability to survive won the day. The other, foreign and unfamiliar with its own set of rules, not designed for her success. In her Advanced Placement classes and outside of her neighborhood, she felt unwelcomed and judged because of the way she talked, dressed and wore her hair. </p><p>After moving to Las Vegas to live with her paternal grandmother, she worked nights at a food court in one of the Mega Casinos while finishing school. Having figured out the college application process by eavesdropping on the few white kids in her predominantly Black and Latino school along with the help of a long ago high school counselor, Mason eventually boarded a plane for Howard University, alone and with $200 in her pocket.</p><p>While showing us her own path out of poverty, Mason examines the conditions that make it nearly impossible to escape and exposes the presumption harbored by many&#x2015;that the poor don't help themselves enough.</p></p><p><b>Dr. C.

What shall we do when confronted with the ache of our suffering in the presence of a living God? <i>A Small Cup of Light</i> is a bold invitation to face God in the darkness. It is a rousing call to the human spirit, offering hope to the hopeless and a song to the suffering. This book is for all those who are suffering or have suffered. It is for those who long for more joy, a richer life, and deeper walk with God; in other words, it is a book for all of us.&nbsp;<i>A Small Cup of Light</i> chronicles Ben Palpant's two year physical, mental, and spiritual crisis. In a matter of a few weeks, he was reduced to an infant-learning again to read and walk and feed himself.

This book is his attempt to re-enter that dark season and come to terms with the mystery, brokenness, and hope that he encountered in the wilderness. Perhaps you are fighting cancer or face unemployment. You might still be recovering from the devastation of a failed marriage or have had a child walk away from your beliefs.

He'd told Savannah that the ghost town was dangerous, that it was a disturbing place. He'd told her over and over not to look for it. And all these years Savannah <em>had</em> stayed away. But the more her brother cautioned her, the more convinced she'd become that she had to find it. If for no other reason than the roses. Roses were Savannah's passion&#x2014;especially old roses, planted before 1867 and now found mostly in cemeteries and abandoned homesteads.<br><br>It was because of the roses that she ignored Grady's advice and began to seek out the long-lost town.<br><br>After a six-week search, roaming about the rugged Texas hill country, first in the truck, then on horseback and finally on foot with no map and little information, she'd located it. Bitter End. What a strange name, but no stranger than the town itself.<br><br>No matter how furious Grady was when he discovered what she'd done, it'd been worth the risk. This certainly wouldn't be the first time she'd defied her older brother. Nor would it be the last. Grady seemed to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders; he rarely smiled anymore. He was as loud and demanding as Savannah was quiet and intense. But her stubbornness was easily a match for his.<br><br>Glancing at the truck's speedometer, she pressed her foot to the floor, although it generally wasn't in her nature to rush. However, her chances of escaping Grady's anger were greater if she got back to the house before he returned from his duties around the ranch. Not that she <em>feared</em> his anger; she simply preferred to avoid it.<br><br>Her brother was so often angry these days, with beef prices dropping and all the other problems associated with running a large cattle ranch. It didn't help that, thanks to Richard, they continued to struggle with debt and financial hardship.<br><br>Savannah forced her thoughts away from the unhappy events of six years earlier. It was wrenching enough to have lost both parents in one devastating accident, but Savannah feared that their brother's betrayal, which had followed so soon afterward, would forever taint their lives with bitterness.<br><br>"Oh, Richard," she whispered as the truck sped down the winding country road. The pain he'd wrought in her life and Grady's was the kind that even love would never completely heal.<br><br>Grady had changed in the years since their parents' tragic deaths&#x2014;and Richard's betrayal. Finances and other concerns had harassed and tormented him until she barely knew him any longer. Through sheer stubbornness and backbreaking work he'd managed to accomplish the impossible. He's saved the Yellow Rose Ranch, but at a terrible price. Grady had sacrificed himself and his youth to hold on to the land that had been settled by their great-great-grandfather shortly after the Civil War. Or, as her Southern grandmother called it, the War of the Northern Aggression.<br><br>Savannah had wanted to help with their finances; after all, she had a college education. It would be a small thing to return to school and take the necessary courses to obtain her teaching certificate. The Promise school board had repeatedly advertised for substitute teachers, and a full-time position was bound to become available within a few years. Grady, however, wouldn't hear of it. He needed her on the Yellow Rose, and Savannah accepted that. She handled the majority of the paperwork, cooked, cleaned the house and did the gardening. She'd indulged her love for roses, started keeping goats and occasionally hand-raised orphaned or abandoned calves. For six years she'd picked up the slack and made a decent life for herself. But compared to Grady, she didn't feel she was doing nearly enough.<br><br>Her desire to contribute to the family income had prompted her to establish a mailorder business for her roses, and while Grady had politely listened to her plans, he hadn't encouraged them. Her small venture was just now starting to show a profit, of which Savannah was extremely proud. In the past few months she'd been spending her evenings working on a catalog.<br><br>What Grady needed, in Savannah's opinion, was to marry and start a family. At thirty-five he was well past the age most men settled into family life. He probably would've done so long before now if he hadn't been required to dedicate every waking minute to the ranch. She wondered whether it was too late, whether he'd ever get married. Savannah herself had long since given up any hope of marriage and children. Her maternal urges would have to be satisfied by her animals, she told herself wryly. She'd turned thirty-one her last birthday and hadn't dated in the past four or five years. She rarely thought about having a relationship anymore. Men didn't understand her quiet ways or appreciate her strength or gentleness of spirit. It no longer mattered. She was content with her life. She'd learned to take pleasure in small things&#x2014;the beauty of flowers, the affection of animals, the comfort of a wellordered house.<br><br>Indian paintbrush, bluebonnets and pink evening primroses, all in bloom, lined the twisting road. Savannah loved spring. The scent of the air brought with it the promise of warm weather and new life. Grady and Wiley, the hired hand who'd been with them so many years he was more family than foreman, had assisted in delivering fourteen calves this week and were looking for that many more in the next couple of days.<br><br>Savannah glanced at her watch and hoped Grady had been delayed this afternoon. Otherwise he was going to have a conniption, especially when he realized where she'd gone.<br><br>Sighing, she turned the familiar bend in the road and caught sight of an abandoned truck parked close to the ditch. Savannah didn't recognize the vehicle; that in itself was unusual. People who didn't know the area hardly ever wandered this far off the beaten path.<br><br>The truck had seen better days. The color had faded badly and a large dent in the side revealed a section where rust had eaten a hole the size of a small plate. With the truck parked as it was, fifteen miles outside of town, far from anywhere, Savannah couldn't help wondering if something was wrong. She might have stopped to investigate if she hadn't been in a hurry.<br><br>The decision was taken from her a few miles down the road when she saw a cowboy walking, carrying a saddle. Even from this distance she could see how weary he was; he seemed to be favoring one side, limping discernibly.<br><br>At the sound of her approach, he straightened, shifted the weight of his saddle and stuck out his thumb.<br><br>Never in all her life had Savannah stopped for a hitchhiker, but this man, miles from anywhere and walking in the opposite direction from town, must have been spent.<br><br>Savannah pulled over and eased to a stop. She opened the door and climbed out. "Is that your truck parked back there?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am," he answered politely. He was tall and wiry, about her age, she guessed. His Stetson rested low on his brow, shading his face from the afternoon sun. When he touched his fingers to the brim in greeting, she noticed that his eyes were pale blue. "I'd be much obliged for a ride."<br><br>Although she'd stopped, Savannah hesitated, unsure what to do. "I wasn't headed toward town."<br><br>"As far as you'd take me would be appreciated. Your truck's the first vehicle to come along in more'n two hours." He gave her a tired smile. "I'd hoped to find a ranch and use the phone there, but I haven't seen one yet."<br><br>Apparently he didn't realize he was walking away from Promise. "I live ten or so miles down the road." Shielding her eyes from the glare of the sun, she pointed toward the Yellow Rose. Riding with her would only take him farther from where he needed to go. She was about to explain as much, then realized he was tired, hurting and probably hadn't eaten a decent meal in hours, if not days. Grady wouldn't be pleased, but... She shrugged off the prospect of her brother's wrath.<br><br>"If you like, you can stay the night in the bunkhouse and I'll drive you to town in the morning."<br><br>She could tell that her offer surprised him; his eyes widened briefly. "That's mighty kind of you, ma'am."<br><br>The fact that he called her ma'am made her feel dowdy and old-fashioned. She supposed that was exactly what she was, though. No one had to tell her she looked older than her age. She usually wore full-length dresses rather than the more fashionable shirt and jeans; her mother had encouraged this, saying that dresses complimented her tall willowy figure. She'd grown accustomed to working in them, donning an apron for household chores. Her thick straight blond hair fell down her back, almost to her waist. Grady had teasingly called her a flower child of the sixties, and in some ways, she did resemble a hippie. "I'm Savannah Weston."<br><br>"Laredo Smith." Again he touched the brim of his hat.<br><br>"Pleased to meet you," she said, and smiled shyly. "Laredo's an unusual name."<br><br>He grinned as if the comment was familiar. "So I've heard." He hitched the saddle higher and added, "My given name's Matthew, but when I was a kid and we moved away from Texas, I wanted to take part of it with me. From that day on I only answered to Laredo. After all these years, I don't know who Matthew is, but Laredo...well, it's a comfortable fit and suits me just fine."<br><br>Savannah couldn't have said why, but she had the impression that these details weren't something he shared often. She told herself it was silly to feel honored&#x2014;but she did, anyway.<br><br>She must have smiled because he responded with a grin of his own. It amazed her how a simple smile could transform his drained features. A hint of something warm and kind showed in his sun-weathered face, mesmerizing her for a moment. A little shocked by her own response, Savannah decided she was being fanciful and looked away. Laredo Smith was a stranger and she'd do well to take care.<br><br>"If you'd like, you can put your saddle in the truck bed," she offered, and walked to the back to lower the tailgate.<br><br>The leather creaked as he lifted it from his shoulder and wearily set it down. He hesitated when he saw the roses and reached out a callused hand toward the fragile buds. Gently he fingered a delicate pink petal.<br><br>"They are antique roses, aren't they?" He closed his eyes and breathed in the distinctive perfumed scent of the flowers.<br><br>His knowledge surprised her. Few people knew about old roses or had heard the term. In her research Savannah had learned that many of the roses found in Texas were of unknown lineage, recovered from hidden corners and byways in an ongoing search-and-rescue mission&#x2014;like the one she'd been on that very day. Savannah was well aware that some would describe her as a "rose rustler"; it wasn't how she thought of herself. Her overwhelming motivation was her love of the flowers.<br><br>"You know about old roses?" she asked.<br><br>"My grandmother had a rose garden and she grew roses passed down by her own grandmother. It must be at least twenty years since I saw one. Where'd you ever find these?"<br><br>Her pause was long enough for him to notice. "In an old graveyard," she said. "Near, um, an abandoned town." While it was the truth, it wasn't the <em>entire</em> truth, but Savannah didn't dare add any details about the ghost town. Only a few people in Promise had even heard of Bitter End. And although Grady had repeatedly warned her against seeking it out, he'd never told her exactly what was so threatening about the long-deserted town.<br><br>Only now did Savannah understand her brother's concerns. The dangers weren't found in the crumbling buildings or the abandoned wells; no, they weren't so easily explained. She couldn't help shuddering as she remembered the sensation of...darkness that had come over her when she'd first set foot on the still, silent grounds. Even that didn't adequately describe the emotions she'd experienced. It wasn't a feeling of evil so much as a pressing sadness, a pain and grief so raw that a hundred years hadn't dimmed its intensity.<br><br>Knowing little of the town's history, Savannah had felt defenseless and almost afraid. Years earlier, Grady and two of his friends had heard their parents discussing Bitter End, but when Savannah questioned her mother, she'd refused to talk about it. From Grady, Savannah had learned that the town was said to have been settled by Promise's founding fathers. Why they'd moved, what had happened to prompt the relocation, was an unsolved mystery. For all she knew, it was something as mundane as water rights. Although that would hardly account for what she'd felt...<br><br>Despite Grady's warnings, Savannah had found Bitter End and dug up the old roses in the graveyard, but she hadn't ventured beyond the fenced area beside the church. She left as quickly as she could. By the time she made it back to the truck, she was pale and trembling.<br><br>She'd driven away without looking back. She hadn't investigated any of the other buildings, and she was annoyed now for letting the opportunity pass. She might have found more old roses had she taken the time to search.<br><br>"They're beautiful," Laredo said. The light pink bud, perfectly formed, lay like a jewel in the palm of his hand.<br><br>"They truly are exquisite, aren't they?" The sheer joy and excitement she'd felt on discovering the roses quickened her voice. "I just couldn't be happier! It's so much more than I hoped to find!"<br><br>His gaze held hers and he nodded, seeming to share her enthusiasm.<br><br>Warming to her subject, Savannah added, "It's incredible to think they've survived all these years without anyone to care for them."<br><br>Laredo gently withdrew his hand from the rosebud.<br><br>"Would you be more comfortable if I rode in the back, ma'am?" he asked.<br><br>"Savannah," she insisted.<br><br>The smile returned again, briefly. "Savannah," he echoed.<br><br>"You're welcome to ride in front with me."<br><br>He climbed slowly into the cab and she could see that the action pained him considerably.<br><br>"I don't suppose you know anyone who's looking for a good wrangler?" he asked.<br><br>"I'm sorry, I don't," she said with sincere regret.<br><br>He nodded and winced, pressing his hand against his ribs.<br><br>"You've been hurt," she said.<br><br>"A cracked rib or two," he answered, obviously embarrassed by her concern. "My own damn fault," he muttered.<br><br>"A horse?"<br><br>"Not exactly." His voice was rueful, a bit ironic. "I got shoved against a fence by a bull. You'd think that after all these years working ranches, I'd know better than to let myself get cornered by a bull."<br><br>"My daddy cracked a rib once and he said it left him feeling like he'd been gnawed by a coyote, then dumped over a cliff."<br><br>Laredo chuckled. "Your daddy sounds like he's got quite a sense of humor."<br><br>"He did," Savannah agreed softly, starting the engine.<br><br>She knew the tires hitting the ruts in the road would hurt him, so she drove slowly and carefully.<br><br>Laredo glanced over his shoulder&#x2014;to check on his saddle, Savannah suspected. She was surprised when he mentioned the roses a second time. "I never thought to smell roses like those again."<br><br>"I'm so glad I found them!" she burst out. "These are the best ones yet." Their scent was sweet and strong and pure, far more aromatic than modern...</p><h2>The Sea King</h2><p><p><strong>A 2017 RT Reviewer's Choice Nominee for Best Fantasy Romance!</strong></p><p><strong>From the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Winter King</em> comes a breathtaking new tale of love and adventure set in the mystical land of Mystral</strong></p><p><strong><em>He wasn&#x2019;t supposed to choose her...</em></strong></p><p>Seafaring prince Dilys Merimydion has been invited to court the three magical princesses of Summerlea.

Having already achieved success in his career around the end of the 19th century, the Polish journalist negatively portrayed the Teutonic Order at a time in which his audience lived under German rule. At the same time, he meticulously included historical language in his works, a sort of celebration of authenticity and the past. He would earn a Nobel Prize in 1905 for "outstanding merits as an epic writer." Sienkiewicz mastered historical novels that vividly put readers in places as distinct as 17th century Poland and Ancient Rome. He is still well regarded today for novels like "With Fire and Sword", "The Deluge", &#x201c;Quo Vadis&#x201d;, and "Fire in the Steppe". The first of the three novels that formed the &#x201c;Trilogy&#x201d;, With Fire and Sword is Sienkiewicz&#x2019;s historical novel about historic Poland. The novel strings together battles for Poland's survival and for a woman, who is a symbol of Poland itself.</p><p>Sienkiewicz won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905.</p><h2>Tao Teh Ching (Shambhala Pocket Library)</h2><p><b>A lucid translation of the well-known Taoist classic by a leading scholar--now in a Shambhala Pocket Library edition.</b><br><br>Written more than two thousand years ago, the <i>Tao Teh Ching</i> is part poetry and part paradox, yet always dynamic and profound.

It's his wife-she died last year.<br><br> If you go through that door, passing a cart, a mule, and a heap of junk along the way, you come to a dirt floor. In the middle of the room there's a metal pole stuck into the ground. A female bear called Vela spent almost twenty years tied to it.<br><br> "I loved her as if she were my own daughter," says Marinov, as he casts his mind back to those mornings on the Black Sea when he and Vela, dependent on each other, pointed their noses in the direction of the water, had a quick bite of bread, and then set off to work along the road as the asphalt rapidly heated up. And those memories make him melt, just as the sunshine would melt the asphalt in those days, and he forgets about his cigarette until the lighted tip starts to burn his fingers; then he tosses the butt onto the brown-and-black earth, and he's back in Dryanovets, outside his gray house with the death notice pinned to the door frame.<br><br> "As God is my witness, I loved her as if she were human," he says, shaking his head. "I loved her like one of my immediate family. She always had more than enough bread. The best alcohol. Strawberries. Chocolate. Candy bars. I'd have carried her on my back if I only could. So if you say I beat her, or that she had a bad time with me, you're lying."<br><br> 2.<br><br> Vela first appeared at the Marinovs' house at the beginning of the gloomy 1990s, when Communism collapsed, and in its wake the collective farms, known in Bulgaria as TKZS-trudovo kooperativno zemedelsko stopanstvo, or "labor cooperative farms"-began to go under. "I was a tractor driver at the TKZS in Dryanovets. I drove a Belarus tractor and I loved my job," says Marinov. "If I could have, I'd have worked at the collective farm to the end of my days. Nice people. The work was tough sometimes, but it was in the open air. We never lacked a thing."<br><br> But in 1991 the TKZS began to slow down. The manager called Marinov in and told him that under capitalism a tractor driver must not only drive a tractor but also help with the cows, and the sowing, and the harvest. Marinov had helped people to do other jobs on very many occasions anyway, so he couldn't see any problem. The manager replied that he understood all that, but that even if his tractor drivers were multifunctional, he couldn't keep twelve of them on under capitalism-because until then there had been twelve at the TKZS in Dryanovets. At most, he could keep three. Marinov was made redundant.<br><br> "I was given three months' pay in advance-then that was it, good-bye," he recalls, and adds: "If you go out of my house, walk a short way to the right, and stand on the hillock, you'll see what's left of our collective farm. It was a beautiful farm, three hundred cows, a thousand acres, extremely well run! Most of the people working there were Gypsies, because the work was too stinky for Bulgarians. Now it has all fallen through, and instead of working, the Gypsies sit around unemployed. But the milk they sell in the market at Razgrad is German. Clearly it's worth it for the Germans to have big farms but not for the Bulgarians."<br><br> In 1991 Marinov had to ask himself the basic question that every redundant worker has to face: "What else am I capable of doing?"<br><br> "In my case the answer was simple," he says. "I knew how to train bears to dance."<br><br> His father and grandfather were bear keepers, and his brother, Stefan, had kept bears ever since leaving school. "I was the only one in the family who'd gone to work at the collective farm," says Marinov. "I wanted to try another life, because I already knew about bears. Lots of bear keepers got jobs at the farm, as I did. But I grew up around bears. I knew all the songs, all the tricks, all the stories. I use to bottle-feed my father's two bears by hand. When my son was born, he and the bears were kept together. There were plenty of times when I got it wrong-my baby drank from the bear's bottle, and the bear from his. So when they fired me from the collective farm, there was one thing I knew for sure: if I wanted to go on living, I had to find a bear as fast as possible. Without a bear, I wouldn't survive a year.<br><br> "How did I find one? Wait, let me light another cigarette and then I'll tell you the whole story."<br><br> 3.<br><br> "I went to the Kormisosh nature reserve to get a bear. It's a well-known hunting ground; apparently Brezhnev forgave our Communists a billion leva of debt in exchange for taking him hunting there. So I was told by a guy who worked at Kormisosh for forty years, but I don't know if it's true.<br><br> "First I had to go to Sofia, to the ministry responsible for the forests, because I had a friend there from school. Thanks to him, I got a voucher for a bear, authorizing me to buy one at Kormisosh, so from Sofia I went straight to the reserve. They knew of me there by hearsay, because my brother, Stefan, had been to them in the past with other bear keepers, and in those days he'd been a real star. He used to perform at a very expensive restaurant on the Black Sea, where the top Communist Party leaders used to go. He was on television several times. Lots of people all over Bulgaria would recognize him.<br><br> "Stefan got his bear from a zoo in Sofia. A drunken soldier had broken into the bear enclosure, and the mother happened to have cubs at the time, so she attacked him and killed him on the spot. They had to euthanize her, as they always do if a zoo animal kills someone. Stefan heard about it and went to buy one of the cubs.<br><br> "At the restaurant show, first came some girls who danced on hot coals, and then he was on. He'd start by wrestling with the bear and end with the bear massaging the restaurant manager's back.<br><br> "Then a long line of people would form, to have the bear massage them too. My brother earned pretty good money that way. Of course he had to share it with the manager, but there was enough for both of them.<br><br> "So I went to Kormisosh. The forester asked me to pass on his greetings to my brother, and then they brought out the little bear. She was a few months old. They're best like that, because they're not too attached to their mothers yet-they can still change keepers without making a fuss. If you take an older bear away from its mother, it can starve itself to death.<br><br> "So she's looking at me. And I'm looking at her. I'm thinking, 'Will she come to me or not?' I kneel down, hold out my hand, and call, 'Come here, little one.' She doesn't move, just gazes at me, and her eyes are like two black coals. You'd fall in love with those eyes-I tell you.<br><br> "I took a piece of bread out of my pocket, put it in the cage, and waited for her to go inside. Again she looked at me. She hesitated for a moment, but then she went in. 'Now you're mine,' I thought, 'for better or worse.' Because I was fully aware that a bear can live with someone for thirty years. That's half a lifetime!<br><br> "I paid thirty-five hundred leva for her, but I didn't regret a single penny. She went straight to my heart at once. That money was my payoff from the collective farm, plus a little more that I'd borrowed. In those days you could buy a Moskvich car for about four thousand.<br><br> "But I couldn't afford a Moskvich as well, so I went part of the way home with the cub by bus, which was an immediate pleasure, because all the children were interested in my bear and wanted to pet her. I took it as a good sign. And it showed I'd gotten a really great bear, friendly and lovable. And then I thought, 'Your name will be Valentina. You're a beautiful bear, and that's a beautiful name, just right for you.' And it stuck. Valentina, or Vela for short.<br><br> "Then we had to transfer to a train, and Vela traveled in the luggage compartment. The conductor didn't want a ticket for her; he just asked me to let him pet her. Of course I did. But I also insisted on paying for a ticket. That's what I'm like-if you owe something, you have to pay, and that's final. I always used to buy Vela a ticket, like for an adult person, without any discount for petting her. There was just one occasion when the conductor insisted. He said someone in his family was in the hospital, and he regarded the bear as a good sign, as good luck for that person. I could see it mattered to him, so that one time I didn't pay up."<br><br> 4.<br><br> "The biggest problem I had was with my wife. Because I went to Kormisosh without telling her. And when I suddenly appeared at the front door with a bear, she went crazy.<br><br> "'Are you out of your mind? What sort of a life are we going to have?' she screamed, and came at me with her fists flying. I gave in to her, and left the house.<br><br> "I'd always done my best to live in harmony with my wife, and I can't say I wasn't upset at her for screaming like that, but I did understand her to some extent. The life of a bear keeper isn't easy. Of course, he can earn a living. You see this house? It's still standing thanks to our Valentina. On a good day at the seaside I earned more than I did in a whole month at the collective farm.<br><br> "But it's a job that has its price. You have be on the alert the whole time to make sure the bear doesn't go wild and harm you-Vela was with us for twenty years, but you could never drop your guard for an instant. You don't know when your bear's instincts might awaken. A man I know in the next village, Ivan Mitev, had had his bear for fifteen years. He bought her at the circus, so you might think he'd never have any trouble with her-her mother and grandmother had never known freedom, so her instincts should have been well suppressed. Until one day Ivan failed to tie her up properly, and she broke loose, killed three hens, and ate them. How she did it, I don't know. Vela sometimes had hens flapping around her head while she slept, but it never occurred to her to eat them. But it happened with Mitev's bear. Once her instincts had awoken, she started attacking people-the keeper, his wife, and their children. She kept trying to bite them. Suddenly they had a major problem. Unfortunately, a bear has no sense of gratitude and won't remember that you've fed it corn and potatoes for the past fifteen years. If it goes wild, it'll start to bite.<br><br> "On top of that, bear keepers aren't exactly welcome among people. We're not respected. I had a problem with this for ages, and I never, ever performed with Vela either here, in Dryanovets, or in the neighboring villages. Only when I reached Shumen, and that's almost forty miles away from us, would I take out my gadulka, or fiddle, and start to work.<br><br> "So when I brought the little bear cub home, my wife knew perfectly well how it would all end. Women are very wise, and the moment she saw that shaggy little creature she also saw the people who'd laugh at us, the nights we'd spend out in the rain, and us trailing from yard to yard in the hope that someone would toss us a few pennies.<br><br> "But I knew my dearly departed wife, as well. And I knew that if I put up with her outburst of anger, she'd soon come to love the bear like her own child.<br><br> "I wasn't mistaken. By the time the first winter came, she was urging me to make Vela a shelter as soon as possible or the animal would freeze. And whenever it rained, she took an umbrella and ran to the tree where Vela was tied up, to make sure the little bear didn't get wet. If she could have, she'd have kept her in the house, the way some city folk keep dogs."<br><br> 5.<br><br> "When I brought the cub here, the worst trouble I had was from a major in the militia-or had it been renamed the police by then? I can't remember-those changes happened so quickly that no one could keep up with them. When he found out I had a bear cub, he came and said, 'Citizen Marinov, I've heard you're keeping a bear at your place. I'll give you seven days to get rid of it.'<br><br> "I tried arguing, saying, 'But Mr. Major, what do you mean? I bought it legally. I have a receipt from the Kormisosh park. Anyway, thanks to your economic transformation they've taken away my job, so let me do something else!'<br><br> "But the major refused to listen. 'You've got seven days,' he said. 'And that's my last word on the matter, Citizen Marinov.'<br><br> "It was suspicious, because there were six other bears in our village at the time, including the one belonging to my brother, Stefan. So why was he picking on me? I don't know. Maybe he'd had enough of the bears. Or maybe he wanted a bribe. I didn't bother to ask. It was all legally aboveboard, so there was no reason for me to give him anything. I went to Shumen, to see the people who represent the Ministry of Culture, and I asked them to call Sofia at my expense, and there they confirmed that I had all the necessary documents. You couldn't keep a bear illegally. A vet had to examine it, and the Ministry of Culture had to confirm that my program would be of high artistic quality. The ministry confirmed that I had all the papers, in Razgrad they issued me an extra bit of paper, and the militia major was told to leave me in peace.</p><h2>The Good News About Marriage: Debunking Discouraging Myths about Marriage and Divorce</h2><p><p><b>Divorce is not the biggest threat to marriage.

I wanted to correctly cite the most recent divorce rate but was confused by conflicting sources and articles. After trying to figure it out for two or three hours (a lifetime in the newspaper business), I tossed it to my then research assistant (now senior researcher) Tally Whitehead, so I could keep working on the column. But after several more hours, Tally came back even more perplexed than when we started.<br><br>It can&#x2019;t be this difficult, I thought. We quickly called a respected expert on marriage and divorce and asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the exact divorce rate?&#x201d;<br><br>Her unexpected answer: &#x201c;No one knows.&#x201d;<br><br>Huh? Before I could say anything, she continued, &#x201c;And it depends on what you mean by the &#x2018;divorce rate.&#x2019; There are many different types of divorce rates. There are also many different surveys, of different groups of people; there are different ways of tracking the rate of divorce today and projecting it in the future. They all say different things. There&#x2019;s no way to know one &#x2018;exact&#x2019; rate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well...&#x201d; I tried to gather my flustered thoughts. &#x201c;Just an estimate, then. Roughly what percentage of marriages will end in divorce? Like, what does the Census Bureau say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Census Bureau stopped projecting divorce rates in 1996. And even those projections were based on divorce increasing, and it&#x2019;s decreased instead. That won&#x2019;t help you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The divorce rate has decreased? Really? But it is still around 50 percent, right?&#x201d; After all, I&#x2019;d heard for years that half of all marriages end in divorce.<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, the divorce rate has never hit 50 percent. It has never even gotten close. Again, it depends on what you mean by the divorce rate, but no matter what definition you use, we&#x2019;re significantly below 50 percent right now. It is maybe closer to 30 to 40 percent, but again, no one knows.&#x201d;<br><br>My first thought was Nuts! I&#x2019;m going to have to edit my column.<br><br>My second thought was But wait a minute. What? The divorce rate has never gotten close to 50 percent? Why haven&#x2019;t we heard this before? That&#x2019;s a really big deal!<br><br>That was eight years ago. And only gradually over the next few years did I begin to realize what a big deal the truth actually was&#x2014;not only about that, but about several other marriage and divorce myths. Myths that are very discouraging...and very common.<br><br>Why It Matters That We Get to the Truth<br><br>As part of the relationship research that my husband, Jeff, and I have done over the past twelve years, we have interviewed and surveyed thousands of people about their innermost thoughts, needs, and fears. Early on, we began to get a clear window not only into their needs as men and women, which was what we were primarily trying to study, but also into how their relationships worked, what inspired and discouraged them, what they believed about marriage, parenting, the workplace, and culture. Eventually it was clear that there was one common denominator among marriages that survived versus those that failed: hope. There were many different factors that led to either outcome,<br>of course. But underneath it all was this bottom line: Did the couple have a sense of hope...or a sense of futility?<br><br>A couple could go through a terrible period, but if they felt certain they would make it, they usually did. Even if a couple lacked that certainty, the hope that things could get better was often enough to keep them going. With a feeling of We can get through this, they would do what was needed to right the ship, patch the holes, and keep sailing. <br><br>But if a couple instead thought This is never going to get better or We&#x2019;re not going to make it, they usually seemed to have a different outcome. A sneaking feeling of futility took over and with it a sense of inevitability. They assumed things would never change, even if they wanted them to. Instead of motivating the couple to fight harder for their marriage, their belief in approaching doom had the opposite effect. After all, if the ship is going to sink anyway, why bother working so hard to bail it out? Far better, they think, to work on escaping the wreck intact.<br><br>In other words, a couple&#x2019;s futile feeling We aren&#x2019;t going to make it ends up being one of the main reasons they don&#x2019;t make it. Those who work directly with troubled couples&#x2014;counselors, therapists, clergy, and marriage mentors&#x2014;told me they generally agree. If even one spouse has a sense of hope that things can change, or simply a vision to keep going no matter what, it is amazing how often that one-sided commitment keeps the marriage afloat long enough to get it sailing again. But it is tough to overcome both spouses having a sense of futility.<br><br>The Big Cultural Problem<br><br>The problem is that we have a culture-wide sense of futility when it comes to marriage, a feeling that, as you will see in the following chapters, is based on conventional wisdom that simply isn&#x2019;t true! I hear it everywhere. A sense of discouragement about marriage, and the evidence that seems to justify it, saturates our culture. The idea that half of all marriages end in divorce, for example, is accepted as fact.<br><br>For years, and with all good intentions, we have been thinking and talking about marriage as being in trouble. We comment on the &#x201c;unhealthy&#x201d; state of our unions and the &#x201c;skyrocketing rate of divorce.&#x201d; I cannot count the number of times I myself have referenced the 50 percent divorce rate from the stage in my marriage conferences! Many books, TV shows, radio programs, speeches, and sermons also discuss just how often happiness fades in marriage. Married couples talk about beating the odds, while live-in couples ponder, Why should we bother getting married? And in the process we are absorbing a vastly inflated sense of futility. Because although there are indeed plenty of legitimate concerns about marriage, there are others&#x2014;a lot of others!&#x2014;that are closer to myth than reality.<br><br>I am guilty of spreading every one of those myths myself. But not anymore. After an eight-year investigative study, I now know that although there are plenty of challenges, most marriages are still far stronger, happier, and longer lasting than most of us realize. It is so important for us to get that truth out there because, as mentioned earlier, the belief otherwise can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>Another consequence of our cultural discouragement is that many couples avoid marriage altogether for the same reason. I recently read an excerpt of a popular book, This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage, in which the author explained why she avoided marrying her boyfriend for eleven years: &#x201c;By not marrying Karl, we could never get divorced. By not marrying him, he would never be lost to me.&#x201d;1<br><br>After years of interviews and surveys, I have heard this type of fatalistic reasoning more times than I can count, and it is undoubtedly one reason for some of the cultural concerns that are accurate and that worry those who care about marriage. For example, more people today are living together as their first step, instead of or before marrying.2 More than four in ten children are being born to unmarried women.3 And one reason for these trends is the sheer number of people who think getting married is futile.<br><br>Those who work directly with couples are just as concerned as the couples themselves. I know I sure used to be, as I would speak at a marriage conference, look out over the audience, and wonder how many of them would be divorced in a few years. And in the church community where I often do those marriage conferences, I find that pastors, priests, and counselors are even more discouraged. They, after all, are often the ones most likely to be contacted when a marriage goes wrong. I can no longer count the number of pastors who have expressed, &#x201c;It is so discouraging to marry a young couple and know that they have only a one in two chance of making it.&#x201d;<br><br>And it&#x2019;s not just in the Judeo-Christian world that clerics are troubled. After seeing in a church conference advertisement that I would be sharing my research about the small things that make a big difference in marriages, a local Muslim imam came for the day to take notes. Afterward, we spent some time talking, and he explained his concerns for those he ministers to: <br><br>In my community, we have a lower divorce rate, I think. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean we have a better feeling about<br>marriage. It doesn&#x2019;t mean we have figured out how to do marriage well. We have many couples from other countries;<br>some are in arranged marriages. Traditionally, a couple gets married expecting to be together for life, whether or not they are happy. But now, here [in America], that isn&#x2019;t enough. Usually a family is here because they want the American pursuit of happiness. They see it on TV and they want that great life, that good marriage, but don&#x2019;t always know how. And they don&#x2019;t always have the structure around them to help&#x2014;the grandparents or the friends. And when one person in our community gets divorced, they worry that they will be next. They need this encouragement that they can make it.</p><h2>The Carving of Mount Rushmore</h2><p>The first book to tell the complete story of Rushmore.<br><br>"I had seen the photographs and the drawings of this great work. And yet, until about ten minutes ago I had no conception of its magnitude, its permanent beauty and its importance." &#x2014;<i>Franklin Delano Roosevelt, upon first viewing Mount Rushmore, August 30, 1936</i><br><br>Now in paperback, <i>The Carving of Mount Rushmore</i> tells the complete story of the largest and certainly the most spectacular sculpture in existence. More than 60 black-and-white photographs offer unique views of this gargantuan effort, and author Rex Alan Smith&#x2014;a man born and raised within sight of Rushmore&#x2014;recounts with the sensitivity of a native son the ongoing struggles of sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his workers.<br></p><p><b>Rex Alan Smith</b> is also the author of <i>Moon of Popping Trees</i>, the story of the Wounded Knee Massacre, and the co-author of Abbeville's <i>One Last Look</i>.<br><i>Foreword</i><br><br>High on a pine-clad mountain in South Dakota's Black Hills are the carved faces of four presidents of the United States&#x2014;George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt&#x2014;each chosen for such commemoration because of his unique contribution to the building and shaping of his country.<br><br>Created as a monument not only to those men but also to the aspirations and ideals of the nation they did so much to mold, the four faces together constitute the world's most gigantic piece of sculpture. Eight hundred million pounds of stone were removed in its carving, and so huge are the faces that from brow to chin each is as tall as the entire Great Sphinx in Egypt. Ordinary men of the same proportions would stand shoulder-even with a forty-story building and could wade the Mississippi River without dampening their knees. Yet, so skillfully are the faces carved that to an observer viewing them from across the canyon they do not appear massive or coarse or even heavy. On the contrary, they look as graceful and lifelike as the finest busts sculpted in a studio. Carved upon a cliff that has changed but little since mankind first appeared on earth and has worn down less than the thickness of a child's finger since Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, the faces will still be there, looking much as they do now, long after man has gone. All things considered, Mount Rushmore National Memorial is not only America's greatest and most enduring monument, it is all of mankind's as well.<br><br>Today the memorial is visited by well over two million people a year. When these visitors ask, as most do, "Who created it?" they are answered almost invariably with, "The sculptor, Gutzon Borglum."<br><br>In a limited sense that answer is true, but only in a limited sense. Certainly it is true that without Borglum's genius and stubborn dedication the monument might never have been carved, and the Rushmore cliff might look little different now than it did a million years ago. But that is only part of the story.<br><br>The Rushmore monument also came from the dreams of a gentle, aging scholar named Doane Robinson, and from the levelheaded judgment and legislative skill of United States Senator Peter Norbeck. Equally important was the down-to-earth business sense of Jon Boland, a dealer in farm implements, and the integrity and legislative ability of William Williamson, a United States congressman and attorney. Just as Borglum brought to the work talents these men did not possess, they brought to it talents Borglum did not possess. All together these men are to the Rushmore work as legs are to a table. It rests upon them all. Lacking any one of them it would have fallen, yet no single one of them could claim credit for the fact that it did not fall.<br><br>And there is more to the story, for the Rushmore memorial to a substantial extent is also the product of a United States president who learned how to fish, and to a very great extent that of a bunch of hard-working, hard-playing, drill-dusty miners who did the actual work of the carving. They came not even qualified to learn the art of mountain-carving, but learn they did, and the monument stands as everlasting evidence that they learned it well.<br><br>Beyond what it owes to these men, the memorial is a creation of two brief consecutive moments in our national history&#x2014;the booming 1920s and the depressed 1930s. Only because these were the kind of times they were and occurred in the sequence they did was it possible for the Rushmore project to have been conceived, approved, executed, and paid for. Even so, the challenges were so enormous and the difficulties so nearly insurmountable that it almost failed. Most people who view the monument today do realize there were great challenges to be met in its construction. They know also, since the monument does exist, that those challenges were not impossible to overcome. The creators, however, were denied the comfort of such knowledge. Attempting to do that which never had been done before, they were never sure it could be done. When obstacles arose or money ran out, as both were always doing, time and again the machinery was covered, the work was abandoned, and the mountain was returned to silence. And each time this happened there was ample reason to believe the project could not be revived again...ever.<br><br>Eventually, the time did come when the work had to be permanently shut down and the carving left uncompleted according to its original design, and it happened for a reason that the builders could neither have avoided nor foreseen. Although the first World War was supposed to have made the world "safe for democracy" it had not done so. By the end of the 1930s, the free nations of Europe again were fighting for their very survival, and the United States was attempting both to supply them with the arms they needed and to rearm itself as well.

Rather, it is a complex story of men and their times&#x2014;of unusual men and unusual times combined in a sometimes caustic but always creative chemistry that ultimately produced something far different from what had been originally intended.

Most of those units were created during the war and served only for the duration of the conflict. After going overseas and fighting to achieve victory, most of the World War II divisions were disbanded and faded into obscurity.<br><br>This heavily illustrated narrative is the story of one of those units, the 12th Armored Division, which trained on the plains of West Texas at Camp Barkeley near Abilene. From its initial action, to the liberation of Nazi death camps, to the ultimate victory and peace, the division's story serves as a vehicle to study the many temporary army units that served our country during its most trying time.</p><p>JOHN C.

But the National Guard of 1940 consisted of only eighteen divisions and, America's war planners believed that a much larger Army was necessary to engage in any type of offensive action overseas in either Europe or Asia, or certainly both. So new divisions had to be created.</p><p>Most of the new divisions created by the Army were infantry divisions, as it is the infantry soldier who had historically fought and won battles and wars. But it was evident to observers that the shockingly sudden collapse of France in May 1940 was brought about largely as a result of German armor. The impact of massive formations of tanks on the battlefield was unmistakable, and the United States Army determined to have sufficient numbers of armored units.</p></p><h2>Coming of Age: Growing Up in the Twentieth Century</h2><p>A <i>New York Times</i> bestseller when it was first published in 1995, <i>Coming of Age</i> presents an astonishing portrait of American life and the experience of aging in the twentieth century, drawn from the stories of seventy-four very different people, the youngest of whom is seventy and the oldest ninety-nine.

A gifted and wealthy young naturalist, Banks collected exotic flora from Madeira, Brazil, Tierra del Fuego, the Society Islands, New Zealand, Australia, and Java, bringing back over 1,300 species that had never been seen or studied by Europeans. On his return, Banks commissioned over 700 engravings.

The wealth that flowed into Egypt allowed its kings to commission some of the most stupendous temples of all time, some of the greatest dedicated to Amun-Re, King of the Gods. Yet a century later these temples lay derelict, the god&#x2019;s images, names, and titles all erased in an orgy of iconoclasm by Akhenaten, the devotee of a single sun-god. This book traces the history of Egypt from the death of the great warrior-king Thutmose III to the high point of Akhenaten&#x2019;s reign, when the known world brought gifts to his newly-built capital city of Amarna, in particular looking at the way in which the cult of the sun became increasingly important to even &#x2018;orthodox&#x2019; kings, culminating in the transformation of Akhenaten&#x2019;s father, Amenhotep III, into a solar deity in his own right.</p><p>AIDAN DODSON is a senior research fellow in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Bristol, where he teaches Egyptology.

She&#x2019;d go on if she wanted to.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all a bit of a bugger.&#x201d; She sighed audibly down the line. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to have surgery next Monday and then some chemo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the surgery for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To remove my gallbladder.

Things don&#x2019;t appear very rosy at the moment. I may have only a few months left.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh God, I thought. What does one do when given that scenario? Do you try to carry on as normal or attempt to cram as much into the remaining time as possible? In reality, I suspected that treatment and feeling ill would take over everything. Not very rosy indeed.</p><p>I realized that I hadn&#x2019;t been paying attention to the flow of humanity passing by in front of me.</p><p>Concentrate, I said to myself, and went back to studying faces.</p><p>It was Champion Hurdle Day, the first of the annual Cheltenham Steeplechasing Festival, and, in spite of the inclement weather, a crowd of over fifty thousand was expected to cram into the Gloucestershire racetrack. Everyone had an umbrella or a rain hat of some kind&#x2014;ideal conditions for the unwelcome few to hide among the masses.</p><p>I knew by sight all those who had racetrack-banning orders, but I was on the lookout for one particular individual that our intelligence branch had suggested might come to Cheltenham that day.</p><p>A large man walked up to the kiosk to buy a race program, standing there while he hunted for change in his pockets. I shifted my position to see past him, looking over the head of the program seller who sat directly in front of me.</p><p>It was a role I was used to.</p><p>My name was Jeff Hinkley and I was an investigator for the British Horseracing Authority. Hence, I spent much of my time half hidden, scanning faces, watching out for those who had no place in racing. Not that being banned from entering racetracks ever stopped them trying.</p><p>Cancer of the gallbladder.</p><p>How could Faye, my big sister, have cancer of the gallbladder?</p><p>Faye was forty-two, twelve years my senior, and she had acted like a mother to me after our real mom had died when I was eight.</p><p>I wondered if cancer was hereditary.</p><p>Our mom had died of it but I didn&#x2019;t know where the cancer had been in her body. It was something that wasn&#x2019;t talked about either before or after her death.</p><p>I spotted a face in the crowd.</p><p>Nick Ledder, an ex-jock, banned from all racetracks for three years for attempting to bribe another young jockey to lose. I watched as he scanned his ticket and hurried through the turnstile with his coat collar turned up against the icy wind and a tweed cap pulled down over his forehead. It was his eyes that I spotted. It was always the eyes.</p><p>But his was not the face I was really looking for.</p><p>Nick Ledder was a small-time crook of limited intelligence who hadn&#x2019;t been able to resist taking a handful of readies to try to fix a race and he had paid a heavy price for his folly. He was hopeful of getting his riding license back early, but he&#x2019;d hardly endear himself to the stewards by sneaking into Cheltenham while he was still banned.</p><p>I let him go by, I could always find him later, and went back to scanning other faces.</p><p>I thought about gallbladders. What did they do if you could live without one?</p><p>&#x201c;Jeff, are you there?&#x201d; said a voice in my earpiece.</p><p>&#x201c;Here, Nigel,&#x201d; I replied via the microphone I wore on my left wrist.</p><p>&#x201c;Any sign?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Nick Ledder&#x2019;s here. I saw him. I&#x2019;ll deal with him later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bloody fool.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How about you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Nigel Green was a colleague of mine in the BHA Integrity Service. He was watching the south entrance. Two other BHA staff were covering the remaining ways in, but Nigel and I reckoned that our target would most likely use either the north or south entrance where the crowds were bigger&#x2014;that is, if he came at all.</p><p>I continued to study faces and tried to keep my mind off gallbladders and chemotherapy. How could she have cancer?</p><p>My task would have been easier if I had known none of the people funneling through the turnstiles. Then I would just have had to look for someone familiar. As it was, I knew about a quarter of those passing in front of me: owners, trainers, jockeys, as well as other regular racegoers that I had seen many times before. One of the reasons I had a job with the Integrity Service was because I had an uncanny knack of remembering faces and of putting names to them.</p><p>I watched as Duncan Johnson, a top steeplechase trainer, made his way into the racetrack followed closely, and rather indiscreetly, by a young woman twenty years his junior with whom he was currently having an affair. Mrs. Johnson, meanwhile, was nowhere to be seen. She would probably be at home in Lambourn waiting expectantly for James Sutton, a young groom from the village, who would come and spend the afternoon in bed with her, enjoying the racing on Channel 4 and other things, just as they did on most Saturdays.</p><p>It was amazing what one could discover simply by frequenting the Lambourn pubs and keeping one&#x2019;s eyes and ears open. Snooping was a major part of my job, but I&#x2019;d learned to be discreet and inconspicuous, asking very few questions myself whilst encouraging others to ask for me.</p><p>Duncan Johnson drifted away out of my sight with his high-heeled concubine clicking away on the tarmac five paces behind him, fooling nobody.</p><p>What sort of gall did a gallbladder store?</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t had time to search on the Internet as Faye had called me just as I was leaving my hotel for the racetrack. I&#x2019;d look it up later.</p><p>The human swarm was beginning to thin out as the first race approached, most people having arrived early to grab a bite and a beer before the start of proceedings, with time to make their selections and place their bets. Those held up in the race-day traffic now hurried through the turnstiles, making a beeline for the betting ring and the grandstand.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re off!&#x201d; The public address announced the start of the first race of the Festival, greeted as always with a huge roar from the excited crowd.</p><p>Perhaps the cancer has been caught early.</p><p>I knew Faye had been for tests after having pains in her abdomen over Christmas, but she&#x2019;d assumed it was kidney stones, something she&#x2019;d had once before.</p><p>What had she said that morning? <i>I may have only a few months left.</i> But Faye always tended to look on the darker side of life.</p><p>As she had also said, time would tell.</p><p>My mind was drifting again and I almost missed him.</p><p>Just as the race was coming towards an exhilarating finale with the crowd cheering, the target came through the end turnstile in a rush, hurrying on as if he wanted to catch the finish, a red scarf wound around his neck and mouth and with a battered and damp trilby pulled down hard over his ears. Again, it was the eyes that gave him away.</p><p>&#x201c;Bingo,&#x201d; I said into my microphone. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s here. Following now.&#x201d;</p><p>I slipped out of the race-program kiosk and scurried along behind him, keeping about ten yards back.</p><p>He went past the shops of the tented village then turned right towards the concourse between the parade ring and the grandstand. There was purpose in his progress as if he had a specific agenda rather than merely wandering around. Perhaps, as we suspected, he was on his way to meet someone. But why here when it would be safer to do so elsewhere in private?</p><p>Suddenly he stopped completely and turned around to face me.</p><p>Bugger.</p><p>I went past him without breaking step and without a glance in his direction, instead looking down at the iPhone in my hand.</p><p>I knew he wouldn&#x2019;t know me.</p><p>I&#x2019;d hardly recognized myself that morning as I looked in the hotel bathroom mirror. I was constantly being ribbed by my colleagues, but I believed that I was most effective if none of those I was pursuing knew what I really looked like. Hence, I used disguises, frequently changing the color of my own curls, or using wigs and various degrees of facial hair, glued in place with a latex-based adhesive.</p><p>A good disguise was all about distracting people&#x2019;s attention away from the eyes. Give them something else to stare at and they might remember that feature but would not recognize the man beneath.</p><p>On that particular day I sported a well-trimmed goatee with collar-length dark hair under a brown woolen beanie, as well as a faded green anorak over a gray shirt and navy sweater, plus blue chinos. I purposely didn&#x2019;t want to look like one of the &#x201c;establishment,&#x201d; but equally I needed to blend into the background.</p><p>I went on twenty strides and then stopped, half turning back. I put my cell to my ear as if making a call and, using my thumb on the touchscreen, I silently took two photos back towards the target.</p><p>He was moving again and I stood quite still, talking to no one on my phone, as he walked right past me. I waited for a moment, letting him get ten or fifteen yards away, before following him up past the bookshop and the confectionary kiosk and then on towards the Centaur Centre and the Tattersall end of the grandstand.</p><p>We were moving against the human traffic that was spilling out of the grandstand towards the winners&#x2019; enclosure now that the race was over.</p><p>The target pressed on into the stream, forcing his way through, as I struggled to keep up behind him.</p><p>I almost lost him altogether as a group of six well-built and inebriated punters insisted on walking in line abreast, jostling me to and fro with guffaws as I tried to get past.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the &#x2019;urry, mate?&#x201d; said one as he pushed me back. &#x201c;Got a date, &#x2019;ave you?&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed enthusiastically at his own weak joke and took another swig from his beer while I ducked under his raised arm. How could anyone, I wondered, be drunk after only the first race?</p><p>I scanned the mass of heads in front of me, searching for a battered trilby.</p><p>Where had he gone?</p><p>I rushed forward in desperation and almost ran straight into the back of the target as he himself was slowed by the congestion in the pinch point beneath the Hall of Fame.</p><p>Calm down, I told myself.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you still got him, Jeff?&#x201d; Nigel asked into my ear.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said quietly into my left sleeve.</p><p>&#x201c;Need any help?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Under the Hall of Fame bridge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On my way,&#x201d; Nigel replied.</p><p>The target was on the move again, ducking into one of the bars beneath the grandstand.</p><p>&#x201c;Going into the Winged Ox bar,&#x201d; I said into my sleeve.</p><p>&#x201c;OK,&#x201d; came the reply. &#x201c;One minute away.&#x201d;</p><p>The bar was packed with long queues at every counter, but the target was clearly not here to get a drink. Instead, he weaved his way right through the throng and out onto the now almost empty viewing steps beyond.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been close to him as he crossed the teeming bar, but now I hung back so as not to alert him to my presence.</p><p>I watched as he stood for a moment, moving his head from side to side as if searching for something, before setting off again down the steps.</p><p>What was he doing here? I asked myself again. Surely he must know that meeting someone at a racetrack was likely to provoke a reaction from the racing authorities.</p><p>I went out onto the viewing steps and looked down.</p><p>The target moved swiftly towards where the lines of bookmakers were sheltering from the rain under their multicolored and name-branded umbrellas.</p><p>Had he come to speak to a bookmaker?</p><p>Nigel Green joined me.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our man,&#x201d; I said, pointing, &#x201c;with the red scarf.&#x201d;</p><p>The target was about twenty yards away and, as we watched, he took his right hand out of his coat pocket. His hand was not empty.</p><p>&#x201c;Knife! Knife!&#x201d; I shouted loudly, rushing down the steps.</p><p>My shouts were swept away by the wind and there was nothing I could do but watch as the target went straight up to one of the bookmakers and slashed at his throat. There was no warning, no words at all, just a clean swipe of the blade across the bookie&#x2019;s unprotected skin, which turned instantly from pink to bright red.</p><p>It had occurred so fast that even those standing close by seemed not to realize what had happened until the bookmaker in question toppled face-first onto the wet tarmac, blood gushing from the wound in his neck like a scarlet fountain.</p><p>Meanwhile, the target moved away, walking fast along the line of bookmakers, dodging other racegoers, some of whom were running towards the spot behind him where a woman had begun screaming loudly.</p><p>I went on following the target while Nigel went to tend to the victim.</p><p>So that was why he&#x2019;d come. Not to meet or to talk but to kill.</p><p>I followed him along to the end of the grandstand, where the food stalls were doing brisk business. He turned right and started up the slope towards the south exit. I hurried after him, the need for stealth now ended.</p><p>He glanced back over his shoulder, noticed me pushing my way through the hamburger queue, and began to run.</p><p>I ran after him, towards the entrance, where late arrivals were still streaming through the turnstiles.</p><p>The official at the exit gate alongside the turnstiles wouldn&#x2019;t let the target out. He kept asking for his ticket so it could be scanned for reentry.</p><p>I was by now just a few feet away. The target looked up and saw me watching him.</p><p>He panicked and reached into his coat pocket for the knife, its blade still showing red.</p><p>&#x201c;Get back,&#x201d; he shouted, waving the knife in front of him. &#x201c;Get back, all of you.&#x201d;</p><p>I stepped back a pace or two while others moved much farther away.</p><p>&#x201c;Give it up,&#x201d; I said to him. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no escape.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked around with wide eyes and grabbed hold of the gateman, who had been cornered next to his gate.</p><p>&#x201c;Open the gate,&#x201d; the target ordered, ignoring the two large policemen in bright yellow jackets who had appeared on its far side, one of whom was talking urgently into his radio. &#x201c;Open the bloody gate!&#x201d; He was desperate.</p><p>The gateman tried to comply, but in his haste and nervousness he couldn&#x2019;t get the latch to open.</p><p>&#x201c;Give yourself up,&#x201d; I shouted, but the target simply waved his knife more vigorously, slashing it towards me.</p><p>I retreated a few more steps.</p><p>More police arrived and a standoff ensued, with the target holding the unfortunate gateman in his left hand, with the knife in his right.</p><p>&#x201c;Open the gate or I&#x2019;ll kill him.&#x201d; The knife...</p></p><h2>Winds of the Storm</h2><p><p>Archer Le Veq owes his life to the woman who rescued him from certain death at the height of the Civil War...a woman known only as "the Butterfly."

Suddenly his dreams are within reach when he discovers that his father-whom he&#39;d been led to believe was dead-is very much alive. A wealthy businessman, he seems eager to give his son a new start. Youssef leaves his mother behind to live a life of luxury, until a reversal of fortune sends him back to the streets and his childhood friends. Trapped once again by his class and painfully aware of the limitations of his prospects, he becomes easy prey for a fringe Islamic group.In the spirit of The Inheritance of Loss and The Reluctant Fundamentalist, Laila Lalami&#39;s debut novel looks at the struggle for identity, the need for love and family, and the desperation that grips ordinary lives in a world divided by class, politics, and religion.</p><p>Laila Lalami was born and raised in Morocco.

Following Augustine's critique of the Roman religious, political, and intellectual tradition in Books 1-10, Books 11-22 set out his great vision of the origins, the histories, and the ultimate destinies of the two cities: the earthly city, rooted in love of self as expressed in the pride and lust for domination that shatter human society, and the heavenly city, rooted in love of God as expressed in the humility and yearning for the supreme good that unite humanity in a just social order. For all those who are interested in the greatest classics of Christian antiquity, <i>The City of God</i> is indispensable.<p>This long-awaited translation by William Babcock is published in two volumes, with an introduction and annotation that make Augustine's monumental work approachable. <b>The INDEX for Books 1-22 (both volumes of <i>The City of God</i>) is contained in this volume.</b></p></p><p>"This is a magnificent new translation, sure to be welcomed by readers of Augustine old and new. It is certainly worthy of a place among the great translations of this work, offering an eminently readable and accurate rendition. One forgets one is reading a translation -- isn't that the goal of all great translating? Highly recommended."<br><b>John Cavadini</b>, Professor of Theology and Director of the Institute for Church Life, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"This lucid translation of Augustine's complicated Latin text, complemented by an expert introduction and helpful notes, is a remarkable achievement indeed. A new jewel in the crown of an already famous series that is highly appreciated worldwide."<br><b>Johannes van Oort</b>, Editor of Vigiliae Christianae; Author of Jerusalem and Babylon (1991; paperback: Leiden-Boston 2012)<br><br>"All will be grateful for Babcock's new subheadings and summaries, which trace the articulations of Augustine's carefully connected argument. His long reflection and deep understanding, expressed in his outstanding Introduction, shape every sentence of this clear and thoughtful translation."<br><b>Gillian Clark</b>, Professor Emerita, University of Bristol; Co-editor, Oxford Early Christian Studies<br><br>"William Babcock's <i>City of God</i> is likely to become the new standard thanks to a first-rate introduction, helpful scholarly aids, a substantial index, and a translation into a contemporary English that is clear enough for students to understand yet reliably close to the original."<br><b>Paul R. Kolbet</b>, Lecturer in Early Christianity, Yale University; Author of Augustine and the Cure of Souls (Notre Dame 2010)<br><br>"The monumental <i>City of God</i> has astonishingly relevant things to say to an age of postmodernism, secularism, multiculturalism and globalisation. This affordable new translation with useful notes will make this masterpiece accessible to the 21st century reader."<br><b>Karla Pollmann</b>, Professor of Classics, University of St. Andrews"[T]his translation fully justifies the praise that has already been heaped on it. Lyrical without any sacrifice of sense, it compares consistently well with both Dyson and Bettenson and is certainly the most beautiful and up-to-date of the existing versions ... Augustine used multiple Latin versions of the Bible besides Jerome's, including his own, and one great advantage of the edition under review is that, where past translators have used pre-existent English versions of the Vulgate for scriptural citations, Babcock renders each scriptural quotation directly and individually ... Babcock takes the unique step of removing the titular headings which have formed an integral part of the work since the first printed edition, but which are in all probability non-authorial ... Its absence has a clarifying effect ... The notes are comprehensive enough to suffice for any level of reader and are given as footnotes for ease of reference (neatly including the kind of material on key people and events that is glossarial in the Cambridge University Press edition) ...

But more than blue ribbons is at stake. As Nancy quickly learns, these horses generate big money, turning a friendly competition into a very nasty business. <br> Discovering a fire in the stables, Nancy barely averts a terrible tragedy. But now she faces a new danger: a valuable horse has vanished, and it's up to Nancy to save it. She pursues the truth down a trail of greed, deception, and sinister secrets...only to find herself in jeopardy!</p><p>Carolyn Keene is the author of the ever-popular Nancy Drew books.<b>Chapter One: <i>A Hot Beginning</i></b><br>"Look at that gorgeous horse!" Bess Marvin exclaimed as she looked out the passenger side window of Nancy Drew's Mustang.<br>Nancy slowed the car and glanced at the horse being led along the grassy edge of the gravel drive. It was a sleek chestnut with rippling muscles.<br>As they drove past, the horse pranced sideways. "It <i>is</i> gorgeous," Nancy said. "I'll bet we see a lot of beautiful horses this weekend."<br>Nancy and Bess were at the Illinois Horse Park to attend the week-long Midwest Grand Prix Dressage Championships. They were meeting Bess's friend Lee Anne Suna. It was Friday morning, and Nancy and Bess were going to bunk with Lee Anne for a long weekend.<br>For the past year Lee Anne had been working for and training with former Olympic rider Klaus Schaudt at High Hills Farm. Nancy and Bess had had lunch with Lee Anne a week earlier, and she'd spent the entire time talking about the equestrian sport of dressage. Intrigued, Nancy and Bess had decided to attend the competition, and Lee Anne had insisted they stay at the motel with her.<br>Ned Nickerson, Nancy's boyfriend, was also meeting them at the show. His plan was to spend time with Nancy and Bess before his college semester got too busy.<br>"Too bad George couldn't come," Nancy commented.<br>"I'll bet she's having a great time teaching at the soccer clinic," Bess said as she scanned the showgrounds. She pointed to a large gray building. "There's Barn C. That's where Lee Anne said she'd meet us. All of the horses from High Hills Farm are there."<br>"It's good she told you exactly where we should meet her," Nancy said. "I had no idea the horse park was so big."<br>"And crowded," Bess added as a huge van rumbled by, enveloping the Mustang in a cloud of dust.<br>The parking lot was filled with horse trailers, vans, and pickup trucks. Nancy drove around for a few minutes before she found a spot.<br>After she climbed out of the car, she shaded her eyes from the hot September sun and surveyed the grounds. From the lot, she could see the indoor arena, a cross-country jumping course, and a few barns, which seemed to Nancy to be the size of warehouses.<br>"The riding rings must be on the other side of the barns," Nancy said.<br>Bess gave Nancy a teasing look. "In dressage you ride in an arena," she said with a laugh.<br>"Well, <i>excuse me</i> for being so dense," Nancy shot back, then both girls burst out laughing.<br>Nancy reached inside the car and pulled out her baseball cap. She put it on over her reddish blond hair, pulling it down low to shade her face from the sun. Then she locked the car and joined Bess.<br>"How many horses did High Hills bring for the competition?" Nancy asked as they headed for Barn C. Both girls were prepared for the warm weather, wearing shorts, sneakers, and sunglasses. They'd also packed jeans and sweatshirts for the cooler evenings.<br>"I'm not sure. But the farm must share the barn with other competitors. The building looks big enough to hold fifty horses."<br>"At least," Nancy said after they stepped through the double doors. Before them stretched a long aisle with a concrete floor. Nancy guessed there were about fifty stalls on either side of the aisle -- a hundred in all.<br>As Nancy walked down the aisle, she peered into the stalls. From each one a handsome horse looked back at her. Some were draped with coolers or fly sheets -- lightweight covers to keep the flies off. Others had wraps only on their legs.<br>The stalls were spotless and thickly bedded with straw. Ceiling fans whirled overhead.<br>"Wow," Bess said. "This is like a fancy hotel. I wonder if this place has room service.<br>"Bess! Nancy!" a voice called.<br>Nancy looked over her shoulder and saw Lee Anne jogging down the aisle.<br>"Hey, you two," Lee Anne said. "I'm so glad you made it."<br>Bess's friend was small and slender. She wore cutoff jeans, a T-shirt that said "Dressage is my life," and paddock boots. Her brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail. Since she wasn't wearing makeup, Nancy thought she looked about twelve years old instead of nineteen.<br>"Lee Anne!" Bess gave her friend a hug. "We thought we'd never find you in this palace."<br>Lee Anne giggled. "Wait until you see <i>our</i> side of the barn. We really fixed it up."<br>"You mean there's another side?" Nancy asked.<br>"Amazing, isn't it?" Lee Anne said. "Barn C holds two hundred horses. There are over six hundred horses competing this week."<br>Lee Anne grabbed Bess's hand. "Come on." She began to tug her friend up the aisle. "I want you to see Aristocrat, Zanzibar, and Curio. Then I want you to meet Klaus and -- "<br>"Michael?" Bess teased.<br>At lunch the week before, Lee Anne had talked a lot about a rider named Michael Raines, who was competing in the Grand Prix. From the way she'd described him, Nancy thought he sounded like a combination movie star, prince, and sports pro. Nancy and Bess couldn't wait to meet him.<br>Lee Anne blushed at Bess's teasing. "Of course you'll meet Michael. He's getting ready for a test, so you're just in time."<br>"Test?" Bess grinned. "Like multiple choice?"<br>"No, silly. His riding test. Dressage is a sport where the rider and horse perform a test made up of movements and figures. Michael's riding Intermediate Two tests. That's really advanced, but this fall he hopes to be riding Grand Prix, which is the highest level."<br>"Dressage seems pretty complicated." Bess said. "I hope I'll be able to follow what's going on."<br>"Don't worry. You'll understand after you've been here for just a day." Lee Anne glanced at her watch. "We'd better hustle. Michael's on in forty-five minutes."<br>Lee Anne set a pace that made and Nancy and Bess jog to keep up. Halfway down the aisle, they turned right into a cross aisle that led to the other side of the stable.<br>When they rounded the corner, Lee Anne said, "There's Michael with Curio."<br>A young man stood beside a horse at the end of the aisle. The horse was a glossy bay. Its mane was braided and its hooves polished. It was bridled, and a lightweight blanket covered it from head to tail.<br>The man was elegantly dressed in a double-breasted black coat with long tails, a black top hat, and white breeches. High black boots reached to his knees.<br>"He looks as if he's going to a wedding," Bess joked in a low voice.<br>"That's called a shadbelly coat," Lee Anne said as she rushed up to Michael.<br>When he saw Lee Anne, Michael frowned impatiently. "Where were you? We've got to hurry. Curio needs a long time to warm up."<br>"I went to meet Nancy and Bess," Lee Anne explained. "You remember -- the friends I told you about?"<br>"Nice meeting you." Michael gave them a polite glance before turning his attention back to Lee Anne. "Meet me in the warm-up arena in fifteen minutes. And don't forget the fly spray."<br>Clucking to his horse, he left the barn, his boots echoing on the concrete floor.<br>Lee Anne flashed her friends an apologetic smile. "Sorry. He's really tense. This is his first time competing Curio, and his ride on Thursday in the warm-up class was just okay."<br>"Where's his regular horse?" Nancy asked.<br>"Midnight Blue's owner decided to show him herself."<br>"So Michael doesn't have a horse of his own?" Bess asked.<br>Lee Anne shook her head as she bent to put a jar of hoof polish into the grooming box. "Many dressage riders don't have horses of their own. Horses competing at Intermediate and Grand Prix levels cost a lot of money, so riders like Michael are at the mercy of the owners. He was ready to compete Midnight Blue this summer when his owner moved the horse to another stable."<br>"That doesn't seem fair," Bess said.<br>"It isn't. Curio's a fine horse, but still, Michael's had to start all over," she said gloomily. "He's trying to rack up enough good scores to qualify for the Pan American team. But now I don't know."<br>She pulled a spray bottle from the grooming box. "We've just got time to see Aristocrat before I have to meet Michael."<br>"That's Klaus Schaudt's horse, right?" Nancy remembered Lee Anne talking about the stallion at lunch.<br>Lee Anne's face brightened. "Right. Klaus has been competing him in Grand Prix since last year. They've done well, too, scoring in the sixty-five to seventy percentile range. They were even on the cover of my favorite horse magazine."<br>"So we're meeting a celebrity?" Bess said.<br>"Kind of," Lee Anne said. "Lots of dressage fans have come by to see Aristocrat up close and to get Klaus's autograph. Gilly's been busy."<br>"Gilly?" Nancy asked.<br>"Aristocrat's groom." Lee Anne walked over to a stall. "She even sleeps next to the horse."<br>The door to the stall was open, and Nancy glanced inside. A cot stood in one corner, a sleeping bag, duffel bag, and pillow neatly laid on top. Bales of hay filled up the other half of the stall.<br>"Gilly must be with Klaus," Lee Anne said. But here's Aristocrat."<br>Nancy joined Bess and Lee Anne in front of a steel-mesh door. In the stall, a brown horse was eating hay. When Lee Anne made a clucking noise, he turned his head to stare calmly at the trio. His coat gleamed, and his mane and tail were neatly brushed. Nancy was surprised that the celebrated horse looked like all the other brown horses in the barn.<br>"He looks like a horse even <i>I</i> could ride," Bess said, echoing Nancy's thoughts.<br>Lee Anne chuckled. "In Aristocrat's case, looks are deceiving. When Klaus rides him into an arena, it's as if a spotlight hits him. He might <i>look</i> like an ordinary horse, but he's worth about two hundred thousand dollars."<br>"Wow," Nancy said. "That <i>is</i> a lot of money." She looked closer, trying to imagine the horse leaping and prancing. Aristocrat only snorted.<br>Bess wrinkled her nose. "I guess we'll have to take your word for it."<br>"You don't need to take my word for it. Tomorrow you can watch him perform."<br>Anxiously, Lee Anne checked her watch. "Well, I'd better go help Michael. You guys should come and see his test. It'll be awesome, and I can explain what's happening."<br>"Sounds great," Nancy said as they headed up the aisle. "I'm really curious about dressage."<br>"Nan and I have been riding since we were about eight," Bess told her friend. "But we don't know very much about dressage."<br>As the three girls neared the cross aisle, Nancy stopped and sniffed the air.<br>Bess and Lee Anne stopped, too. "What's wrong?" Bess asked.<br>"Do you smell smoke?" Nancy asked.<br>There were No Smoking signs posted everywhere. Still, some careless person could have dropped a match or sneaked a cigarette in a stall, Nancy thought.<br>Lee Anne lifted her chin and sniffed, too. "I smell something. We'd better find out where it's coming from. With all the hay and straw in here, this place would go up like a bonfire."<br>Nancy turned in a circle, trying to figure out where the smell was coming from. When she moved down the aisle toward the other side of the barn, she noticed that the odor grew stronger.<br>Breaking into a jog, she took off for the other side. A curl of gray smoke wafted up from a stall to her right. A horse danced in front of the closed mesh door, its eyes wild with fright.<br>Nancy raced over to the stall. The horse whirled crazily, but Nancy spotted flames leaping up from a pile of hay in the far corner.<br>"Fire!" Nancy screamed.<br><br>Copyright � 1998 by Simon &amp; Schuster Inc.</p><h2>Fat Fast Cookbook: 50 Easy Recipes to Jump Start Your Low Carb Weight Loss (Carbsmart Low-Carb Cookbooks)</h2><p><b>Jump-Start Your Low Carb Weight Loss with Fat Fast Cookbook!</b><br> <ul> <li>Are you having trouble losing weight, even on the Atkins Induction phase? </li><li>Have you lost weight successfully on low carb, but hit a plateau or started to regain weight even though you&#x2019;re still following your low carb diet? </li><li>Are you looking for a way to add more healthy fat to your low carb diet? </li></ul> <b>If you suspect you&#x2019;ve been doing something wrong, we&#x2019;ve got your solution.</b><br> <br> Introducing your new low carb weight loss tools: <b>The Fat Fast and Nutritional Ketosis.</b><br> <br> <b>Your Weight Loss Stall Is Not Your Fault</b><br> For years you&#x2019;ve been told that eating fat makes you fat and that a calorie is a calorie is a calorie.

A kind word will not resolve all situations, nor will wristlocks, punches, or even a gun. <i>Scaling Force</i> introduces the full range of options, from skillfully doing nothing to employing deadly force.

Tame Your Anxiety shows you how.<br>Readers learn about the brain chemicals that make us feel threatened and the chemicals that make us feel safe. You&#x2019;ll see how your brain turns on these chemicals with neural pathways built from past experience, and, most important, you discover your power to build new pathways, to enjoy more happy chemicals, and reduce threat chemicals.<br>This book does not tell you to imagine yourself on a tropical beach. That&#x2019;s the last thing you want when you feel like a lion is chasing you. Instead, you will learn to ask your inner mammal what it wants and how you can get it.

You can feel good right now.<br>The exercises in this book help you build a self-soothing circuit in steps so small that anyone can do it.

She is Professor Emerita of Management at California State University, East Bay. The Inner Mammal Institute offers resources that help you rewire your mammalian brain chemistry, including books, videos, podcasts, blogs and graphics. Dr. Breuning&#x2019;s work has been translated into Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, French, Turkish, German, and appeared on Forbes, NPR, Wall St Journal, Psychology Today, Time, Fox, NBC, Dr Oz, Cosmopolitan, Real Simple, Men&#x2019;s Health, and many podcasts. </p>According to Breuning, asking someone to help control your brain is like asking another rider to control your horse. Control comes from within and from understanding just what your mammal brain wants and needs. The human brain is wired to crave happy chemicals, and we are rewarded with these chemicals when the brain strives toward a goal, feels a part of the group, gets recognition, and faces pain. Anxiety occurs when these needs are not met. Keeping this in mind, Breuning outlines a three-step plan to combat anxiety. It includes determining what the brain really wants, distracting the brain by spending 20 minutes on a consuming, pleasurable task, and finally taking one step toward achieving the goal. The author offers suggestions for possible goals, tasks, and action based on her own and others&#x2019; experiences. She believes in designing a program based on an individual&#x2019;s needs and warns of the dangers of seeking relief from anxiety with food, alcohol, and drugs (including prescriptions). Breuning presents a convincing case for controlling anxiety by tapping into natural instincts and drives. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>[Bruening] focuses on neurochemistry to help readers cope with anxiety in this approachable guide. She defines anxiety as a flood of the stress chemical cortisol, an endemic feature of the mammalian brain that evolved to detect threats. She then explains her taming tool: take a pause to determine the actual need, distract oneself with an immersive task for 20 minutes, and plan a next step. Bruening grounds her analysis in chemical considerations, tying the pleasure from reaching goals to dopamine, the drive for social inclusion to oxytocin, the need for social respect to serotonin, and relief from physical pain to endorphins. Bruening also explains how her strategy can create new connections and habits to aid the flow of the positive chemicals to the brain. She highlights possible stumbling blocks in a chapter on general pitfalls, and in another on the overuse of food as a reward. Bruening opposes the contemporary medical model of mental health (&#x201c;The more you believe in an external fix, the harder it is to take internal action&#x201d;), a stance that makes her suggestions better suited to readers with fleeting worries rather than those with clinical anxiety. Nevertheless, readers with mild anxiety will get much out of Bruening&#x2019;s in-depth investigation.

Lane&#x2019;s book is the ideal place to begin."&#x2014;<i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br> In 1545, a native Andean prospector hit pay dirt on a desolate red mountain in highland Bolivia. There followed the world's greatest silver bonanza, making the Cerro Rico or "Rich Hill" and the Imperial Villa of Potos� instant legends, famous from Istanbul to Beijing. The Cerro Rico alone provided over half of the world's silver for a century, and even in decline, it remained the single richest source on earth.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Potos�</i> is the first interpretive history of the fabled mining city&#x2019;s rise and fall. It tells the story of global economic transformation and the environmental and social impact of rampant colonial exploitation from Potos�&#x2019;s startling emergence in the 16th century to its collapse in the 19th. Throughout, Kris Lane&#x2019;s invigorating narrative offers rare details of this thriving city and its promise of prosperity. A new world of native workers, market women, African slaves, and other ordinary residents who lived alongside the elite merchants, refinery owners, wealthy widows, and crown officials, emerge in lively, riveting stories from the original sources. An engrossing depiction of excess and devastation, <i>Potos�</i> reveals the relentless human tradition in boom times and bust.</p><p>&#x201c;Potos� is the stuff of myth and the fuel of enormous global changes. With wonderful quotes and poetic, evocative language, Kris Lane's historical writing is outstanding.&#x201d;&#x2014;Steven Topik, editor of&nbsp;<i>The Second Conquest of Latin America</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can think of no person better suited to write this wondrous story.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tatiana Seijas, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Spanish Dollars and Sister Republics</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;From the leading authority on mining,&nbsp;<i>Potos�</i>&nbsp;combines a strong narrative voice with deft use of primary sources to demystify how global flows of silver shaped world economic history.&#x201d;&#x2014;Zephyr Frank, author of&nbsp;<i>Reading Rio de Janeiro</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When we think of mineral bonanzas, we think of the gold rushes of the 1800s in California, South Africa, and the Klondike. But arguably the discovery of a mountain full of silver at Potos�, in today&#x2019;s Bolivia, centuries earlier, had far more impact on history. Kris Lane tells the full, fascinating story, from the mixture of churches, brothels, riches, and slavery in a 16th century boom town to Potos�&#x2019;s reverberations throughout the Spanish Empire and the world.&#x201d;&#x2014;Adam Hochschild, author of&nbsp;<i>Lessons from a Dark Time and Other Essays</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We overlook too often the primary reasons that explain the socio-economic phenomena we analyze, or denounce. Kris Lane's&nbsp;<i>Potos�: Silver City That Changed the World</i>&nbsp;is an interdisciplinary analysis of the modes of previous accumulation of capital not only related to Europe but on a global scale. This work helps us understand the global context that led progressively, from the sixteenth century, to the industrial revolution. The financial engineering, industrial innovation, scientific discoveries and political will that underlie the first major mining site in Bolivia find their counterparts in the brutal exploitation of workers, social injustice, public health crisis, and, already, ecological negligence. Foremost, in addition to analysis that contribute greatly to the history and critique of political economy, the author focuses on cultural and domestic considerations and on an interdisciplinary point of view, which are not usual in this research field.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alain Deneault, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Imperial Canada Inc: Legal Haven of Choice for the World&#x2019;s Mining Industries</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Like the boom town it describes, Kris Lane&#x2019;s book teems with life and glints with riches.&nbsp;<i>Potos�</i>&nbsp;is a unique urban case-study, which helps us understand how Spain�s global monarchy worked. It contributes vividly to the history of technology. It tells stories of labor, and race. It illuminates the global economy through which the silver of Potos� trickled and rippled. Above all, it is an irresistible portrait of life, work, passion, sanctity, crime, pleasure, misery, madcap consumption, and ecological disaster in &#x2018;an improbable global city&#x2019; that started as &#x2018;a rough-and-tumble mining camp&#x2019; and became &#x2018;the envy of kings.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto, author of&nbsp;<i>Our America: A Hispanic History of the United States</i><br> &nbsp;<b>Kris Lane </b>holds the France V.

It is precious to generation after generation of Christians because of its fusion of gospel and ethics, of faith and morality. This commentary proceeds unit by unit, rather than verse by verse, to emphasize what each passage of Matthew means to the author of the Gospel and to the modern church. Douglas Hare shows that the purpose of Matthew&#39;s writing is to convince Christians that a genuine faith in Christ must be demonstrated in daily obedience and that faith and ethics are two sides of the same coin. According to Hare, the turning point in Matthew is the narrative of Peter&#39;s confession and the subsequent passion announcement. His commentary stresses the close connection between the Great Commission, with which the Gospel closes, and the moral imperatives of the Sermon on the Mount.<b>Douglas R. A. Hare</b> is William H.

Yet, against all odds, this self-professed former "girly girl" daughter of overprotective Cuban immigrants blossomed from NFL cheerleader to Fulbright Scholar to field scientist and ultimately, quintessential adventurer. Now, with more than a decade's worth of thrilling exploits under her belt, Mayor recounts her life in a riveting, awe-inspiring new book. <br>&nbsp;<br>In a series of short chapters, she relives each exhilarating event with uncanny charm and self-deprecating humor. Readers have the rare opportunity to follow the renowned primatologist around the globe as she unlocks the mysteries of the natural world and endeavors to save some of the planet's rarest creatures. Says Mayor: "I love the adventure, the exploration, the scientific discovery and the documentation. But really what drives me is the thought that future generations&#x2014;my own children and their children&#x2014;can one day learn to appreciate them like I do."<br>&nbsp;<br>Throughout this unforgettable volume, she describes in stunning detail how she survived a plane crash...slept in jungles teeming with poisonous snakes...dove with hungry great white sharks...rappelled down a 14,000-foot sinkhole in search of frogs...draws blood from critically endangered lemurs...was charged by an angry silver-backed gorilla...was chased by elephants...and the list goes. Suffice it to say, Mireya Mayor has seen more in her 30-odd years than most of us will see in a lifetime. Her plucky spirit, brilliance in the face of calamity, and sheer will to succeed make this a classic mission book, and a thoroughly breathtaking read.</p></p><p><p> <strong>From <i>Pink Boots and a Machete</i></strong> <br>Click on the images below to open larger versions. </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"My big, small discovery in 2001.

Created in 1934 by the German political cartoonist Erich Ohser (using the pseudonym E.O. Plauen after being blacklisted for his opposition to the Nazi regime), the gruff, loving, mustachioed father and his sweet but troublemaking son embark on adventures both everyday and extraordinary: family photoshoots and summer vacations, shipwrecks and battles with gangsters, a Christmas feast with forest animals and a trip to the zoo. Drawn almost entirely without dialogue, the strips overflow with slapstick, fantasy, and anarchic visual puns. <i>Father and Son</i> remains an uproarious, timeless ode to the pleasures, pitfalls, and endless absurdity of family life.<br><br>This NYRC edition is an extra-wide hardcover with raised cover image, and features new English hand-lettering.</p><p><b>E.O. Plauen</b> was the pseudonym of Erich Ohser (1903&#x2013;1944). In the 1920s, he studied art in Leipzig and began a career as a cartoonist and illustrator. He moved to Berlin in 1927, and began collaborating with his friend, the writer Erich K�stner, including drawing illustrations for K�stner&#x2019;s first book of poetry (which would later be burned by the Nazis). Ohser&#x2019;s caricatures of high-ranking Nazis such as Goebbels and Hitler led to his being banned from publishing after they took power. Unable to use his own name, he paired his initials, &#x201c;E.O.,&#x201d; with &#x201c;Plauen,&#x201d; the town he grew up in, and using this pseudonym created <i>Vater und Sohn</i> in 1934; it appeared in the <i>Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung</i>, to great acclaim, until 1937.

The capture of the Hapsburg city of Vienna was a major strategic aspiration for the Islamic Ottoman Empire, desperate for the control that the city exercised over the Danube and the overland trade routes between southern and northern Europe. In July 1683 Sultan Mehmet IV proclaimed a jihad and the Turkish grand vizier, Kara Mustafa Pasha, laid siege to the city with an army of 150,000 men. </p><p>In September a relieving force arrived under Polish command and joined up with the defenders to drive the Turks away. The main focus of this book is the final 15-hour battle for Vienna, which climaxed with a massive charge by three divisions of Polish winged hussars. This hard-won victory marked the beginning of the decline of the Islamic Ottoman Empire, which was never to threaten central Europe again.</p></p><p>Simon Millar was born in Malaysia in 1957.

A brilliantly creative work that established the reputation of Dutch historian John Huizinga (1872-1945), the book argues that the era of diminishing chivalry reflected the spirit of an age and that its figures and events were neither a prelude to the Renaissance nor harbingers of a coming culture, but a consummation of the old.<br>Among other topics, the author examines the violent tenor of medieval life, the idea of chivalry, the conventions of love, religious life, the vision of death, the symbolism that pervaded medieval life, and aesthetic sentiment. We view the late Middle Ages through the psychology and thought of artists, theologians, poets, court chroniclers, princes, and statesmen of the period, witnessing the splendor and simplicity of medieval life, its courtesy and cruelty, its idyllic vision of life, despair and mysticism, religious, artistic, and practical life, and much more. <br>Long regarded as a landmark of historical scholarship, <i>The Waning of the Middle Ages</i> is also a remarkable work of literature. Of its author, the <i>New York Times</i> said, "Professor Huizinga has dressed his imposing and variegated assemblage of facts in the colorful garments characteristic of novels, and he parades them from his first page to the last in a vivid style."<br>An international success following its original publication in 1919 and subsequently translated into several languages, <i>The Waning of the Middle Ages</i> will not only serve as an invaluable reference for students and scholars of medieval history but will also appeal to general readers and anyone fascinated by life during the Middle Ages.</p><p>In 1919, Johan Huizinga revealed in the original version of this book that the ideals, aspirations, and behaviors of humanity in history were dramatically different from those in present day. In Herfsttjj der Middeleeuwen, he recalled the waning years of the Middle Ages--the low countries in northern Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries--and argued against those who claimed that human belief systems remain the same even if contexts change. His account rested not on historical fact, but on the emotions and ambitions of the people as expressed through the art and literature of their culture. Many people treated the book as groundbreaking work, and it was translated into English in 1924. This new translation is a complete, more direct version of the original and allows modern readers a full appreciation of life in an era rarely revisited.Johan Huizinga is one of the most imporatant historians of the twentieth century. He was Professor of General History at the University of Leyden. While he is best-known for this book, his biography, ERASMUS OF ROTTERDAM, is unsurpassed.</p><h2>Thinking Volleyball</h2><p><p> To be a successful volleyball coach, you need to know more than just how to teach the basic skills and implement a plan.

The intricate weave between systems of play, program culture, and the writer's mastery of storytelling quickly bring the reader to the realization that there is nothing out there on the market like this book. </i></p><p><i> Legendary coach Mike Hebert has the reader asking themselves critical questions right from the beginning of Chapter 1: Learning and Decision Making. The next chapter, Structuring and Running the Program, is packed full of ideas about topics such as team policy, program goals, and event management. In this chapter, Mike tells a great inspirational story about one of his former players and starting Olympic setter, Lindsey Berg. </i></p><p><i> Over the next few chapters, the book takes a close look at different styles of play and the skills of international teams. In his discussion of the international game, Coach Hebert not only takes you on an exploration of the X's and O's of teams from around the world, but also makes observations of what he believes are the psychological principles of these teams. </i></p><p><i> "The coach must decide to impose his will on the team. It is a matter of forcing players out of their comfort zone on a daily basis." This reminder to coaches is in his chapter on defense. He gets the reader to not only think about defensive technique and positioning principles, but also about reading the opposing team's offense and maximizing defensive effort. The next chapter, Drawing a Blueprint for Offense, takes an in-depth look at running an offense and the differences between an in-system offense, out-of-system offense, and counterattacking. </i></p><p><i>The next two chapters, Promoting a Positive Gym Culture and Strengthening Team Trust are where I think this book separates itself from the many other books written on volleyball. As an observing and opposing coach, these are also the areas in which I thought Coach Hebert excelled with his championship-level teams. Amongst the many topics examined in these chapters are: getting teams to compete, working with and keeping injured players engaged, and developing a communication system. He writes, "The absolute most important enabler in team sportss is team-wide, unconditional trust. It is the lynch pin that holds a team together." Mike takes the reader into his team meetings and the activities he did with his teams in order to build team trust, including role playing, showing movie clips, and team readings. He also discusses how to promote development of positive self-talk and learned optimism, as well as how teams should deal with conflict. These two chapters are phenomenal, and they alone are worth the cost of the book. </i></p><p><i> The book doesn't slow down one bit in the last two chapters, Coaching the Match and Thinking Outside the Box. These chapters include a potpourri of tidbits that will get every coach thinking as the reader gets closer to the end. </i></p><p><i> I absolutely loved this book. </i>Thinking Volleyball <i>is a book that every coach at every level should have on his or her bookshelf. Coach Hebert's storytelling will keep you engaged. His layered and full 360 degree look at our profession will certainly have you referring back to chapters as you continue your journey in this wonderful sport." </i></p><p><i> </i><b>Kelly Sheffield-- </b>Head Volleyball Coach University of Wisconsin </p><p><i>"Others that have written analysis have not come as close to the essence of coaching women's volleyball as Mike has in </i>Thinking Volleyball<i>. The chapters on gym culture and trust are remarkable. Unlike other volleyball coaching books of its kind, it digs far deeper, and comes very close to the heart of coaching excellence.

It includes the alternative formations used to handle different tactical problems and different types of terrain; the possibilities of ordering and controlling different deployments once battle was joined; and how all this was based on the particular strengths of the Roman soldier. Covering the period of &#34;classic&#34; legionary warfare from the late Republic to the late Western Empire, Ross Cowan uses case studies of particular battles to provide a manual on how and why the Romans almost always won, against enemies with basic equality in weapon types - giving practical reasons why the Roman Army was the Western World&#39;s outstanding military machine for 400 years.</p><p>Ross Cowan was formerly a research student at the University of Glasgow where he was recently awarded a PhD for a thesis on the Roman army entitled &#39;Aspects of the Severan Field Army AD 193-238&#39;. The major themes of the thesis are the organization of the Praetorian Guard and Legio II Parthica, their recruitment, numbers and equipment. Ross also completed his first degree at Glasgow. In 1999 he was elected a fellow of the Society of the Antiquaries of Scotland.

Books and articles on the man span the gamut from hero worship because of his remarkable battlefield victories, to condemnation for his involvement with the slaughter at Fort Pillow and later, his association with the Ku Klux Klan. Retired Special Forces brigadier general John R. Scales plows entirely new ground with The Battles and Campaigns of General Nathan Bedford Forrest, 1861&#x2013;1865, a careful and unique examination of Forrest&#x2019;s wartime activities and how his actions affected the war in the Western Theater.<br><br>Each chapter covers specific raids or campaigns, all arranged chronologically. After describing the environment within which Forrest operated, which helps readers understand the larger situation within which his movements were made and his battles were fought, Gen. Scales narrates the decisions Forrest and his opponents made and the actions they took. Firsthand sources, including heavy use of documents and reports from the Official Records, coupled with 109 original maps, make it easy to understand the often complex background, movements, and engagements involving Forrest and his command.<br><br>Scales&#x2019; study is also a meticulous guide to Forrest&#x2019;s campaigns. For example, each action is augmented with detailed driving directions to allow readers to examine his battlefields and the routes his cavalry took during its famous raids. For the first time, students of Forrest&#x2019;s campaigns can follow in his footsteps, experiencing the terrain much the same way he did. A detailed review and assessment of each raid or campaign follows the description of the actions and the associated driving instructions. Throughout, General Scales relies upon his own extensive military background to help evaluate and explain how and why Forrest grew in command ability and potential as a result of his experiences&#x2014;or didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>The late award-winning author Albert Castel asked two major questions about Nathan Bedford Forrest: &#x201c;Exactly what impact did Forrest&#x2019;s dazzling raids and victories have upon the overall course of the war?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Had Forrest been given a higher command and/or greater opportunities, what would have been the potential outcome as regards the fate of the Confederacy?&#x201d; The Battles and Campaigns of General Nathan Bedford Forrest makes it much easier to answer both.</p><p>John R. Scales is a retired Special Forces brigadier general with more than three decades of service, including combat tours in Vietnam and Afghanistan. He also has a Ph.D. in engineering and worked in that field after retiring from the military. In addition to receiving five patents for inventions, General Scales has written two previous books: Sherman Invades Georgia (Naval Institute Press, 2006) and A Reluctant Hero&#x2019;s Footsteps (Westbow Press, 2012). A past president of the Tennessee Valley Civil War Roundtable, he leads Civil War campaign tours in Alabama, Tennessee, and Georgia.&#x201c;Students of Nathan Bedford Forrest have long sought to understand his campaigns and tactics, beyond the self-assessment that he &#x2018;got there first with the most men.&#x2019; Now, John Scales takes the reader where Forrest and his men rode and fought, in meticulous detail, and with an eye to understanding why the engagements occurred where and when they did. Following the &#x2018;Wizard of the Saddle&#x2019; has never been more meaningful.&#x201d; (Brian Steel Wills, historian and author of The Confederacy&#x2019;s Greatest Cavalryman and The River was Dyed with Blood)<br><br>&#x201c;Nathan Bedford Forrest was one of the most remarkable soldiers to emerge from the Civil War. Controversial in his time and afterward, Forrest has been the subject of numerous biographies that usually focused on the man and what made him tick. Brig. Gen. (Ret.) John Scales&#x2019; much-needed and long overdue The Battles and Campaigns of General Nathan Bedford Forrest, 1861-1865 is a wholly different type of study. General Scales relies upon his decades of professional service to analyze the military aspects of the cavalryman&#x2019;s Civil War career&#x2014;why he did what he did, and whether it was effective. In addition, this new work includes more than 100 original maps with driving directions so anyone can follow the movements and campaigns of this amazing Confederate general. Scales&#x2019; effort adds tremendously to our knowledge of both Forrest and the Civil War in the Western Theater. I highly recommend it.&#x201d; (Greg Biggs, President, Clarksville, TN Civil War Roundtable)<br><br>&#x201c;...a careful and unique examination of Forrest's wartime activities and how his actions affected the war in the Western Theater... An impressively detailed work of outstanding scholarship, "The Battles and Campaigns of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, 1861-1865" is an invaluable contribution to the growing library of Civil War literature &amp; history.&#x201d; (<i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The Battles and Campaigns of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, 1861-1865 is a uniquely strong combination of narrative history, atlas, and tour guide. Anyone interested in western theater cavalry operations, and those of General Forrest in particular (of course), will benefit from reading this authoritative, and sometimes controversial, assessment of the fighting career of a general that many still consider the Civil War's greatest untutored military genius.&#x201d; (<i>Civil War Books and Authors</i>)</p><h2>Fire in the Soul: A New Psychology of Spiritual optimism</h2><p>The author of the New York Times bestseller Minding the Body, Mending the Mind reveals the power of spiritual optimism: a philosophy that sees life crises as opportunities for personal growth and spiritual transformation.</p><p>More well-meaning New Age psychopop from the author of Guilt is the Teacher, Love is the Lesson (1990), etc. According to psychologist Borysenko, who tends to gush, her ``soul has burned with the question why''--specifically, why does God allow suffering? The answer is found in this, as she puts it, ``extraordinarily special'' book that offers a ``new and much needed psychology'' of healing--new, that is, if one has never cracked open a self-help book or watched Oprah, Phil, or Sally. Borysenko's basic premise is, in fact, as old as the hills: that suffering is ``an opportunity for soul growth.'' She tries valiantly to situate this idea in world religious thought, but she constantly mangles her sources--for instance, repeatedly misreading John of the Cross's ``dark night of the soul,''which refers to an aridity that comes in advanced stages of contemplation, as equivalent to psychological disorders (in Borysenko's own case, a childhood bout with compulsive-obsessive disorder). On the other hand, Borysenko does know her transpersonal psychology, and the book teems with condensations of the ideas of Larry Dossey, John Bradshaw, Stanislav Grof, et al., as well as innumerable plugs for Borysenko's earlier volumes. Despite minor differences, all these writers broadcast the same idea: that spiritual growth is possible but takes effort, including the overcoming of fear, addiction, and other deep-seated traumas. As for methodology, Borysenko seems fond of women's confessional groups, men's drumming groups, and, above all, past-life therapy (we travel back to medieval Britain, among other locales). She's keen on meditation as well, and offers a watered-down, de-Christian-ized version of centering prayer, and a watered-down, de-Buddhist-ized version of walking meditation. This fire in the soul may warm already converted New Agers, but most others will find it wan comfort indeed. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Difficult and tragic events, stresses Borysenko ( Minding the Body, Mending the Mind ), need not ruin our lives. They often bear the seeds of transformational healing and spiritual awakening--if we are willing to receive them and shed old beliefs. In a collection that draws on anecdotes, therapeutic practice, ancient parables, myths and Bible stories, Borysenko guides the reader through "dark nights when our souls are on fire" and toward optimism, affirming the conviction that pain can be a catalyst for growth. Inspirational verse, quotations and biblical passages comprise a final chapter, "Night Lights," and a list of resources is also provided. Practical and contemplative, and giving psychology and spirituality due concern, this book should be a welcome addition to New Age psychology. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Highfire: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>From the&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;bestselling author of the&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Artemis Fowl</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;series comes a hilarious and&nbsp;high-octane adult novel about a vodka-drinking,&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Flashdance-</strong></em><strong>loving dragon who lives an isolated life in the bayous of Louisiana&#x2014;and the raucous adventures that ensue when he crosses paths with a fifteen-year-old troublemaker on the run from a crooked sheriff.</strong><br><br>In the days of yore, he flew the skies and scorched angry mobs&#x2014;now he hides from swamp tour boats and rises only with the greatest reluctance from his Laz-Z-Boy recliner.

Now, as the enmity between their families raged on, Tearle would mount a bold campaign to win the ravishing spitfire's heart -- and save her from his brother's dark and deadly obsession!</p><p>Jude Deveraux is the author of&nbsp;more than forty <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Moonlight in the Morning</i>, <i>The Scent of Jasmine</i>, <i>Scarlet Nights</i>, <i>Days of Gold</i>,<i> Lavender Morning</i>, <i>Return to Summerhouse</i>, and <i>Secrets. </i>To date, there are more than sixty million copies of her books in print worldwide.

Outside on the grounds many men trained, practicing with swords and lances. Some fought on foot, some on horseback.<br><br>Overseeing the training were two men, both big, both muscular, both wearing looks of intense concentration on their handsome faces. These were the two remaining Peregrine brothers, the others having long ago been killed in the three-generations-old feud with the Howards.<br><br>"Where is Zared?" the older Peregrine brother, Rogan, shouted. Sun glinted off his dark hair, showing the red he had inherited from his father.<br><br>"Inside," Severn, the younger brother, shouted back, and he met his brother's eyes. "I saw Zared go," he said, not using the feminine pronoun "she," not letting the men around him know Zared was female.<br><br>Rogan nodded and looked back at the men fighting near him. He had already lost four brothers to the sneaking treachery of the Howards, and two years before he'd almost lost his wife. He did not mean to lose his little sister to the skulking rats, and so he checked often on her whereabouts.<br><br>He glared at the men near him. "Are you women that you fight so softly? Here, I will show you." He took a pike from a knight and attacked. Within minutes the knight who'd tried to fight against him was on his knees. Disgusted, Rogan glared down at the man. He raised the pike as if to strike but instead tossed it to the ground and walked away.<br><br>How could he protect his family, protect what little land the Peregrines had left, when the men who fought for him were so weak?<br><br>He mounted his horse and started toward the castle, but Severn halted him.<br><br>"You mean to see to her?" Severn asked belligerently when they were alone. He was angry that his brother had not taken his word that their young sister was safe.<br><br>"She is disobedient," Rogan answered, scowling. Three weeks earlier Zared had decided to go swimming and had ridden out alone, unescorted, unprotected. At seventeen she had a youth's belief that she could come to no harm.<br><br>"I will see to her," Severn said, trying to relieve his older brother of at least one responsibility.<br><br>Rogan nodded, and Severn reined his horse away. Severn knew all too well how his sister felt, for he, too, had felt the weight of his family's hatred of the Howards on his shoulders. Over the years he'd watched the Howards kill his family one by one. He'd seen his older brothers killed, his father and stepmother starved to death by the Howards. He'd seen Rogan's agony when his first wife and later his beloved second wife had been held captive by the Howards.<br><br>Since the birth of Zared, the only girt born to their father, the family had bonded together to protect her. From the first they had let no one know that anything as fragile and as vulnerable as a female had been born to the Peregrines. They had spread the news that a seventh son had been born.<br><br>After Zared's mother had died, starved in a castle besieged by the Howards, Zared had been raised by her six older brothers. They raised her as they would have another brother, dressing her as a boy, giving her her first sword when she was four, laughing when she'd fallen off horses. Never had they allowed Zared the luxury of believing herself to be a weak, delicate female.<br><br>But now the brothers seemed to be paying for having raised her as a male. Zared acted as independently as any boy of seventeen. She felt that if she wanted to leave the castle grounds, she had that right. She strapped a sword to her belt, hid a dagger in her boot, and thought she could protect herself from an army of Howards.<br><br>Both Severn and Rogan had tried to reason with Zared. As much as the girl liked to think she was strong and skillful with weapons, she was, in fact, merely a puny girl. Rogan's wife, Liana, had had something to say about Zared, but then Liana seemed to have something to say about everything, Severn thought.<br><br>"How could you raise her with a sword in her hand and then one day tell her to sit in the solar with her sewing and think that she would be content to do so?" Liana had asked. "She is the hardheaded know-it-all that you have raised her to be."<br><br>Severn grimaced in memory and thought for the thousandth time that Rogan ought to take a hand to his wife. Her tongue was too sharp by far.<br><br>So now, as if he and his brother didn't have enough to worry about, they had constantly to see about Zared, to make sure she had not taken it into her head to wander about the fields alone.<br><br>As Severn's horse clattered across the drawbridge he smiled. Two days past he'd had an idea about how to get Zared away from the danger of being watched constantly by the enemy Howards, and how to win himself a rich wife at the same time. He had already told Rogan of his plan, and all that was left was telling Zared. He smiled more broadly when he thought of Zared's reaction. For all that she dressed as a boy and swaggered like one, she had a girl's way of showing her pleasure over the smallest things. And Severn knew that what he had planned would give his little sister pleasure.<br><br>Of course, first he had to tell Liana what he intended. She would, no doubt, give him some difficulty, but he knew he could handle her. "A sight better than Rogan does," he muttered, for he thought his brother much, much too soft on the woman. "Ask Liana," Rogan had said when Severn told of his plans for Zared. <i>Ask</i> a woman? "I shall <i>tell</i> her," he said firmly as he dismounted and started up the stairs to Liana's solar.<br><br>Zared stood to one side of the doorway, her cheek against the rough stone and silently watched Liana's women. They laughed and giggled and whispered to one another while sliding dresses of gorgeous silks and velvets over their heads. Now and then Zared could catch a whispered word as they talked about the men of the castle. Zared stood a little straighter when she heard Ralph's name mentioned. He was a young knight her brother Rogan had recently hired, and never had a man affected her as Ralph did. Just walking past him made her heart beat faster and the blood rush to her face.<br><br>"Would you like to try this gown?"<br><br>It took Zared a moment before she realized the woman was speaking to her. She was one of Liana's prettiest ladies, her hair encased in a net of gold, her body corseted and wrapped in velvet, and she was holding a gown of emerald satin toward Zared. Although the secret of Zared's femininity had been kept from her brothers' men, Liana's women knew the truth -- that Zared was a girl.<br><br>Zared almost reached for the gown, but she drew her hand away sharply. "Nay," she said, with as much disdain as she could put in her voice. "I have no need for frivolities."<br><br>The woman, instead of looking as if she'd been put in her place, gave Zared a look of pity.<br><br>Zared tried her best to look haughty and turned away. What did she care for women's finery? For women's gossiping chatter?<br><br>Zared ran down the steep stone stairs and then paused at the second level, stepping back into an alcove when she heard Liana's voice. Zared held her breath as Liana passed.<br><br>In the two years since her oldest brother had taken a wife many things had changed in the Peregrine household: The food was better, the beds cleaner, and there were women all over the place. But Liana had not changed Zared. No amount of arguing with Zared's brothers had softened them into allowing Zared to change. For her own protection Zared must remain disguised as the youngest Peregrine son.<br><br>Of course, Zared told herself, she wouldn't want the confinement of being a woman. She wouldn't want to be like Liana, always confined within the castle grounds, never allowed to ride free, to gallop across a field. Women such as Liana and her ladies had to sit and wait, wait for a man to come to them. But Zared didn't have to wait for anything. If she wanted to go riding, she did so; she didn't have to wait for some man to help her on a horse and then accompany her.<br><br>But sometimes, just sometimes, she wished she could have a woman's wiles. She had been in sword practice with Ralph when one of Liana's ladies had walked past. Ralph had turned away to watch the woman. Zared had been so angered that she'd struck Ralph on the side of his head with the flat of her sword. He'd fallen to the ground, and the men around them had laughed. After that Ralph wouldn't practice with her. Nor would he sit with her, nor, if he could help it, would he remain in the same room with her. Severn said Ralph might think Zared was a boy, but she bothered him just the same.<br><br>After a week of Ralph's hostility Zared had considered asking Liana for a gown, but she couldn't bring herself to ask. If she wore a dress, she might get Ralph's notice, but her brothers would be mightily displeased. If she wore a gown she knew her brothers would no longer allow her outside the castle walls. Was gaining Ralph's favor worth the loss of her freedom?<br><br>She was thinking so hard that at first she did not realize that the voices in the next room had grown much louder.<br><br>"You cannot think to do this," Liana was saying in a voice filled with exasperation.<br><br>Zared knew her sister-in-law had to be talking to Severn, for the two of them were always butting heads. Liana had a way of getting anything she wanted from Rogan, which was one of the things that enraged Severn. Whenever Severn spoke to Liana there was an undercurrent of hostility in his voice.<br><br>"She is my sister, and I will take her," Severn said with anger. "I do not need your permission."<br><br>Zared's ears perked up as she listened.<br><br>Liana's voice grew calmer, as if she were reasoning with the village idiot. "You are barely able to keep her safe here, yet you mean to expose her for all the world to see?"<br><br>"She will be my squire. <i>I</i> will protect her."<br><br>"While you court the Lady Anne? Will Zared sleep with the other squires? Or in your tent with you while you take your whores to bed? Zared is no Iolanthe to stand by and watch while you bed other women."<br><br>Zared sucked in her breath. Liana had gone too far. Lolanthe was the beautiful woman who had lived in the rooms above the kitchen. She had been married, but her old, senile husband had let her live with Severn -- or maybe he hadn't known where his wife was. When the old man died Severn had asked Lolanthe to marry him, but she'd refused. She said she loved Severm, would always love him, but he was too poor for her to marry. She'd returned to her husband's house and within a year was married to a fat, stupid, but very rich man. She'd asked to see Severn again, but he'd refused to see her. Now Lolanthe's name was never mentioned.<br><br>Zared couldn't see Severn, but she knew he was no doubt trembling with rage.<br><br>"Severn," Liana whispered pleadingly. "Please listen to me."<br><br>"Nay, I do not listen to you. I must go to get a wife. I do not want a wife, for I have seen how a wife can change a man, but the coffers must be filled if we are to win the war against the Howards, if we -- "<br><br>"Cease!" Liana shouted. "I can bear no more. It is always the Howards. I have heard of little else since I married into this family. I eat with the Howards, sleep with them. They never leave me. How can you risk your sister's life in your hatred of them?"<br><br>Zared held her breath. Severn wouldn't strike his brother's wife, would he? If he did, Rogan would kill him.<br><br>Yet how could Liana speak so lightly of their enemies? How could she dismiss what the Howards had done to them over three generations?<br><br>Zared released her breath when Severn spoke again. At least he could control himself enough to refrain from tricking Liana. Zared knew what her brother was talking about. A month before a herald had come issuing an invitation to a huge tournament to be held in honor of the marriage of Lady Catherine Marshall. There were rich prizes to be won, including a large emerald, but the herald had hinted that the richest prize was the younger daughter, Lady Anne. She was eighteen, just returned from years spent at the French court, and her father was seeking a good English husband for her.<br><br>At supper, after the herald had left, Severn had announced his intention of going to the tournament and returning with the rich Lady Anne as his wife. That had started a loud argument between Liana and Severn. Liana had said he thought a great deal of himself if he believed he could win a lady of manners and education merely because he could unhorse a few brawny, battle-scarred men. Severn had said Rogan had gotten himself a rich wife, and he planned to do so, too. Liana pointed out that <i>she</i> had chosen Rogan, not the other way around, and she doubted very much if Anne would choose an unshaved, dirty, full-of-himself knight like Severn who also happened to be in love with another woman. Severn dived across the table, going for Liana bodily, and Rogan had had to leap on his brother to prevent him from harming Liana.<br><br>There hadn't been much peace in the Peregrine household after that, and Zared thought the continuing battle was Liana's fault. Ever the organizer, Liana had started to prepare Severn for the tournament. She ordered new garments, embroidered hangings for his horses, planned Severn's tent, planned even the decorations for his helmet. But the more Liana planned, the more Severn dug in his heels and refused to comply with her wishes. After three weeks of arguing, he told Liana that if he had to, he'd sling the Lady Anne over his horse and force her to marry him.<br><br>"You'll have to do that," Liana said. "Force is the only way you'll get her to marry you after she gets near enough to smell you."<br><br>So Severn was planning to leave in two days for the tournament, and he was refusing to take the finery Liana had had made for him. "She will take me as I am."<br><br>"She will not have you at all," Liana had snapped.<br><br>But now he was telling Liana that he planned to take Zared as his squire. Zared smiled in anticipation: to see the world, to hear the music, taste the food, to...<br><br>"She can <i>not</i> go," Liana was saying. "Do you forget that for all her disguise she is a female? What if her sex were discovered? What is to keep some drunken man from her body? She will not be much of a marriage prize without her virginity."<br><br>Marriage? Zared thought. No one had mentioned marriage to her.<br><br>Liana's voice lowered. "What of the Howards? They will know that two of the Peregrines attend the tourney. Will they not try to take one of you? And will it not be the younger, smaller one?"<br><br>"Even the Howards would not offend the king, and he will be there."<br><br>"On the journey there and back, then," Liana said angrily. "Severn, please listen to me. Do not endanger the child's life. Do not let your anger at Iolanthe cause the death of your sister."<br><br>Zared realized that her hands were made into fists, her short nails cutting into her palms. She wanted to show herself to Liana and shout that she could take care of herself, that if any man tried to touch her, she'd use a knife on him. How could Liana think she was so weak that she must be protected like the puniest female? She was a man, not a woman!<br><br>"I mean..." Zared whispered, and to her horror she felt tears coming to her eyes. She was <i>female,</i> but she could take care of herself.<br><br>"She will go with me," Severn said, and his tone made Zared know that he meant to discuss the subject no further.<br><br>Zared pushed away from the wall and ran down the stairs before Severn saw her. Damn them all, she thought. One minute she was on the training field with ...</p><h2>The Big Conservation Lie</h2><p>The Big Conservation Lie&#x2019; is a wake up call focused on a field that has been &#x2018;front and centre&#x2019; of many people&#x2019;s hearts and minds in recent years; The conservation of Africa&#x2019;s wildlife.

I nod like I&#x2019;m listening, like we&#x2019;re communicating, and she never knows the difference.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s not nice when girls die.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t want you hearing it at school or on the news.&#x201d; Jennifer crams the last hunk of muffin into her mouth. &#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I open the dishwasher and lean into the cloud of steam that floats out of it. I wish I could crawl in and curl up between a bowl and a plate. (My stepmother) Jennifer could lock the door, twist the dial to SCALD, and press ON.<br> &nbsp;<br> The steam freezes when it touches my face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; I lie.<br> &nbsp;<br> She reaches for the box of oatmeal raisin cookies on the table. &#x201c;This must feel awful.&#x201d; She rips off the cardboard ribbon. &#x201c;Worse than awful. Can you get me a clean container?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I take a clear plastic box and lid out of the cupboard and hand it across the island to her. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Dad?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He had a tenure meeting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who told you about Cassie?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She crumbles the edges of the cookies before she puts them in the box, to make it look like she baked instead of bought. &#x201c;Your mother called late last night with the news. She wants you to see Dr. Parker right away instead of waiting for your next appointment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; I ask.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good idea,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see if she can fit you in this afternoon.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother.&#x201d; I pull out the top rack of the dishwasher. The glasses vibrate with little screams when I touch them. If I pick them up, they&#x2019;ll shatter. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no point.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She pauses in mid-crumble. &#x201c;Cassie was your best friend.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not anymore. I&#x2019;ll see Dr. Parker next week like I&#x2019;m supposed to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s your decision. Will you promise me you&#x2019;ll call your mom and talk to her about it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Promise.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jennifer looks at the clock on the microwave and shouts, &#x201c;Emma&#x2014;four minutes!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br>(My stepsister) Emma doesn&#x2019;t answer. She&#x2019;s in the family room, hypnotized by the television and a bowl of blue cereal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jennifer nibbles a cookie. &#x201c;I hate to speak ill of the dead, but I&#x2019;m glad you didn&#x2019;t hang out with her anymore.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I push the top rack back in and pull out the bottom. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cassie was a mess. She could have taken you down with her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I reach for the steak knife hiding in the nest of spoons. The black handle is warm. As I pull it free, the blade slices the air, dividing the kitchen into slivers. There is Jennifer, packing store-bought cookies in a plastic tub for her daughter&#x2019;s class. There is Dad&#x2019;s empty chair, pretending he has no choice about these early meetings. There is the shadow of my mother, who prefers the phone because face-to-face takes too much time and usually ends in screaming.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here stands a girl clutching a knife. There is grease on the stove, blood in the air, and angry words piled in the corners. We are trained not to see it, not to see any of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> . . . body found in a motel room, alone . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> Someone just ripped off my eyelids.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thank God you&#x2019;re stronger than she was.&#x201d; Jennifer drains her coffee mug and wipes the crumbs from the corners of her mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> The knife slides into the butcher block with a whisper. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I reach for a plate, scrubbed free of blood and gristle. It weighs ten pounds.<br> &nbsp;<br> She snaps the lid on the box of cookies. &#x201c;I have a late settlement appointment. Can you take Emma to soccer? Practice starts at five.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Which field?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Richland Park, out past the mall. Here.&#x201d; She hands the heavy mug to me, her lipstick a bloody crescent on the rim. I set it on the counter and unload the plates one at a time, arms shaking.<br> &nbsp;<br> Emma comes into the kitchen and sets her cereal bowl, half-filled with sky-colored milk, next to the sink.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you remember the cookies?&#x201d; she asks her mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jennifer shakes the plastic container. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re late, honey. Get your stuff.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Emma trudges toward her backpack, her sneaker laces flopping. She should still be sleeping, but my father&#x2019;s wife drives her to school early four mornings a week for violin lessons and conversational French. Third grade is not too young for enrichment, you know.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jennifer stands up. The fabric of her skirt is pulled so tight over her thighs, the pockets gape open. She tries to smooth out the wrinkles. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let Emma con you into buying chips before practice. If she&#x2019;s hungry, she can have a fruit cup.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Should I stick around and drive her home?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She shakes her head. &#x201c;The Grants will do it.&#x201d; She takes her coat off the back of the chair, puts her arms in the sleeves, and starts to button up. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you have one of the muffins? I bought oranges yesterday, or you could have toast or frozen waffles.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br>(Because I can&#x2019;t let myself want them) because I don&#x2019;t need a muffin (410), I don&#x2019;t want an orange (75) or toast (87), and waffles (180) make me gag.<br> &nbsp;<br> I point to the empty bowl on the counter, next to the huddle of pill bottles and the Bluberridazzlepops box. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m having cereal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her eyes dart to the cabinet where she had taped up my meal plan. It came with the discharge papers when I moved in six months ago. I took it down three months later, on my eighteenth birthday.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s too small to be a full serving,&#x201d; she says carefully.<br> &nbsp;<br>(I could eat the entire box) I probably won&#x2019;t even fill the bowl. &#x201c;My stomach&#x2019;s upset.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She opens her mouth again. Hesitates. A sour puff of coffee-stained morning breath blows across the still kitchen and splashes into me. <i>Don&#x2019;t say it&#x2014;don&#x2019;tsayit.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Trust, Lia.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>She said it.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the issue. Especially now. We don&#x2019;t want . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> If I weren&#x2019;t so tired, I&#x2019;d shove <i>trust </i>and <i>issue </i>down the garbage disposal and let it run all day.<br> &nbsp;<br> I pull a bigger bowl out of the dishwasher and put it on the counter. &#x201c;I. Am. Fine. Okay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She blinks twice and finishes buttoning her coat. &#x201c;Okay. I understand. Tie your sneakers, Emma, and get in the car.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Emma yawns.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hang on.&#x201d; I bend down and tie Emma&#x2019;s laces. Doubleknotted. I look up. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t keep doing this, you know. You&#x2019;re way too old.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She grins and kisses my forehead. &#x201c;Yes you can, silly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As I stand up, Jennifer takes two awkward steps toward me. I wait. She is a pale, round moth, dusted with eggshell foundation, armed for the day with her banker&#x2019;s briefcase, purse, and remote starter for the leased SUV. She flutters, nervous.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wait.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is where we should hug or kiss or pretend to.<br> &nbsp;<br> She ties the belt around her middle. &#x201c;Look . . . just keep moving today. Okay? Try not to think about things too much.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Say good-bye to your sister, Emma,&#x201d; Jennifer prompts.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bye, Lia.&#x201d; Emma waves and gives me a small berridazzle smile. &#x201c;The cereal is really good. You can finish the box if you want.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> 3<br> &nbsp;<br> I pour too much cereal (150) in the bowl, splash on the two-percent milk (125). Breakfast is themostimportantmealoftheday. Breakfast will make me a cham-pee-on.<br> &nbsp;<br> . . . <i>When I was a real girl, with two parents and one house and no blades flashing, </i>breakfast was granola<i> </i>topped with fresh strawberries, always eaten while reading<i> </i>a book propped up on the fruit bowl.

Did I eat dinner the night before, or lunch, or anything?<br> &nbsp;<br> The car in front of us braked as the traffic light turned yellow, then red. My flip-flop hovered above the pedal. My edges blurred. Black squiggle tingles curled up my spine and wrapped around my eyes like a silk scarf. The car in front of us disappeared. The steering wheel, the dashboard, vanished. There was no Cassie, no traffic light. How was I supposed to stop this thing?<br> &nbsp;<br> Cassie screamed in slow motion.<br> &nbsp;<br> ::Marshmallow/air/explosion/bag::<br> &nbsp;<br> When I woke up, the emt-person and a cop were frowning.

She read through it and explained the disaster to my father and then they fought, a mudslide of an argument that spewed across the antiseptic sheets and out into the hall. I was stressed/overscheduled/manic/no&#x2014;depressed/no&#x2014;in need of attention/no&#x2014;in need of discipline/in need of rest/in need/your fault/your fault/fault/fault.

While producing pieces for&nbsp;<em>Jazz</em>, the artist used a large brush to write notes to himself on construction paper.

The original edition of&nbsp;<em>Jazz</em>&nbsp;was an artist&#x2019;s book, printed in a limited quantity. This selection from the original is an exquisite suite of color plates and text that, like the music it was named for, was invented in a spirit of improvisation and spontaneity.

P. H. BROMWELL PAPERS, </p><p>LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</p><p>The Honorable Senator from Illinois, Stephen Arnold Douglas, began digging his political grave with the first item of business before the Senate of the United States on Wednesday, January 4, 1854. For a man approaching the height of his political powers, Senator Douglas did not look particularly uneasy, nor did the instrument he had in hand appear all that lethal. It was simply a "bill to organize the Territory of Nebraska," which Douglas was reporting out of the Senate Committee on Territories and laying before the entire Senate for its action. But it would be the undoing of Douglas all the same, and of the peace of the American Republic.</p><p>Ever since 1803, when Thomas Jefferson shrewdly bought up half the American West in the great Louisiana Purchase, Congress had been slowly organizing the immense landmass of "Louisiana" and setting up provisional governments there as territories -- Missouri in 1812, Arkansas in 1819, Iowa in 1838, Oregon in 1848, Minnesota in 1849. A <i>territory</i> was a legal halfway house between the moment when lands like the Louisiana Purchase were acquired by the United States, and the moment they could be admitted to the Union as full-fledged states. Under Article IV of the Constitution, Congress was responsible for setting up temporary governments in newly acquired lands, subdividing or fixing their boundaries, recognizing each of the new units as an incorporated territory, appointing territorial governors and supervising the creation of territorial legislatures and constitutions, and eventually, if territorial organization was successful, guiding a territory's application for statehood. This process stabilized the rule of law, allowed the people living there a measure of self-government, and created a test period before the territory was fully admitted to the Union as a state. Without it, land titles, law enforcement, incorporation, investment, and development would all hang fire.</p><p>The territorial process, however, was not necessarily rapid. By the time Minnesota was organized as a territory, in 1849, most of the immense bulk of the Louisiana Purchase, from the northern Rockies to the vast plains west of Nebraska, was still without territorial government. And then, in 1848, another expansion-minded president, James Knox Polk, used the Mexican War to acquire the great southwestern triangle of the continent, from the Rio Grande west to California and from Texas northwest to the Great Salt Lake. If the pace of territorial organization in the old Purchase lands was any indication, organizing the huge new American West could take another century.</p><p>No one felt the burden of pushing territorial organization in the West more urgently than Stephen A. Douglas, whose life up to this point read like a primer in the opportunities of western development. Douglas's forebears arrived in Rhode Island as early as the 1640s, but they gradually drifted north and west in search of new land, finally setting up on four hundred acres of land near Brandon, Vermont, in the 1790s. The Douglases acquired enough wealth and standing in Vermont to send Douglas's father to Middlebury College to become a physician, and the elder Douglas soon settled down to marriage and medicine in Brandon in 1811, followed by the birth of Stephen Arnold in 1813. Then, the bliss of the Douglas family abruptly stopped. In 1815, the doctor suffered a fatal heart attack. "I was only about two months old, and of course I cannot recollect him," Douglas wrote years afterward. But "I have often been told he was holding me in his arms when he departed this world." With the death of the senior Douglas died any prospect of Stephen following his father into a lucrative and respectable profession. Despite his "taste for reading" -- his favorite works were "those telling of the triumphs of Napoleon, the conquests of Alexander, and the wars of Caesar" -- and spending "night and Sundays in reading and study," the young Stephen Douglas was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker.</p><p>It was typical of Douglas that he at once began looking for a new way upward. He wheedled permission from his master to attend the Brandon Academy, and when his mother remarried in 1830 and moved to New York, young Stephen was given leave to enter the Canandaigua Academy and then, in 1833, to begin reading law with two local lawyers. But his stepfamily's money began to run dry, and the process of examination and admission to the bar in New York was long and expensive. In mid-1833, he embarked on yet another Douglas move westward, to Cleveland. "When shall we expect you to come home to visit us, my son?" pleaded his mother. "On my way to Congress, Mother," he replied.</p><p>The way to Congress appeared to be no easier for Douglas than the way to law. Cleveland was a professional dead end. Douglas hoped to find work in St. Louis, but St. Louis was already overstocked with lawyers, as were the Illinois towns on the other side of the Mississippi River. It was not until he walked into the middle of a public auction at Winchester, Illinois, in the fall of 1833 and volunteered his services to an auctioneer who needed somebody literate enough to keep track of sales that Douglas finally found himself earning two dollars a day -- as a clerk. This bounty gave him the bright idea of opening a school for clerks. In short order, Douglas had forty pupils and (at the end of the school quarter in March 1834) enough money to support him in a year's law study. Before the end of the year, Douglas was licensed to practice in Illinois and was the proprietor of his own one-man law practice. He was all of twenty-one years old.</p><p>Lawyering followed a short path to politics in Illinois, and never more so than in the volatile year of 1834. The President of the United States, the white-haired but iron-tempered hero of the Battle of New Orleans, Andrew Jackson, had thrown every ounce of his energies against the sucking of the American economy into the maw of the Industrial Revolution. Jackson was a devout old Jeffersonian Democrat -- which is to say that he saw American life in much the same terms as Thomas Jefferson had when Jefferson wrote that God's only chosen people were farmers on their own land. Democrats from Jefferson to Jackson looked uneasily on men who worked in shops for wages, since mere wage earners became dependent on the goodwill of wage payers and were vulnerable to political manipulation by their employers. They looked even more coldly on those who traded in bonds and securities (these were examples of imaginary wealth, whose value could be driven up and down without warning) or who made their living in merchandise and commerce (since they traded in fancy goods which no upstanding farmer really needed but which could trap him in a punitive cycle of debt and dependence). No man who did not own his own land, or who could not live from that land, could ever be truly free and independent.</p><p>This hostility led to political war in 1834 between Jackson and the Second Bank of the United States, the pumping station of the national financial system created by Alexander Hamilton in the 1790s. Andrew Jackson was one of the few real heroes Americans could boast of in the disastrous War of 1812, and he had not defeated one enemy in scarlet coats only to concede to another in silver and gold. The Second Bank became, for Jackson and his allies, a monster with financial tentacles, seeking to reach into every corner of the Republic and entrap its virtuous farmers in paper chains of debt. When in 1834 the bank's president, Nicholas Biddle, challenged Jackson by seeking an early renewal of the bank's charter by Congress, Jackson vetoed the renewal legislation with all the vehemence with which he had bestowed gusts of grapeshot on the British.</p><p>All this should have been of little consequence to a novice lawyer in central Illinois in 1834. But when an attorney from Jacksonville stood up before a local club to which Stephen Douglas belonged and denounced Jackson's veto of the bank as tyrannical and treasonous, Douglas was furious at hearing America's premier military hero flogged verbally like a common bandit. "I could not remain silent when the old hero's character, public and private, was traduced, and his measures misrepresented and denounced," he recalled later, and in a trice, Douglas was on his feet making a speech of his own. A week later, an Illinois Democratic newspaper printed Douglas's speech in "two entire columns" and "for two or three successive weeks," and suddenly Douglas was a political celebrity. He was elected state's attorney for the First Judicial Circuit and then, in August 1836, won a seat in the state legislature. Seven months later, Andrew Jackson's successor in the presidency, Martin Van Buren, rewarded Douglas's faithful party service by appointing him register of the lucrative federal land office in Springfield. In 1838, Douglas ran for Congress on a platform which denounced corporate charters for "railroads, canals, insurance companies, hotel companies, steam mill companies &amp;c., &amp;c." as "unjust, impolitic, and unwise" -- and lost by a squeaker to John Todd Stuart. But in 1840, Douglas was back on the upward spiral when he was appointed by the Democratic governor Thomas Carlin to the Illinois Supreme Court.</p><p>Finally, in 1843, Douglas won the congressional seat he craved in a special election, defeating the formidable lawyer from the Mississippi River town of Quincy, Orville Hickman Browning.

In 1908, Sarah Olds packed up her brood and went homesteading. Her book tells of their hardships, poverty and tribulations.</p><p>Sarah Olds died in 1963 at the age of 88. The foreword was provided by her daughter, Leslie Olds Zurfluh, the fourth of Sarah and A. J. Olds&#39;s six children.&#34;Twenty Miles From a Match is almost required reading for anyone interested in reviewing the homesteading days in Nevada because of either nostalgia, or to learn how our pioneers coped.&#34;-Sparks Tribune &#34;This is the story of the only woman living in the wilderness of northwest Nevada in 1910. It is a down-to-earth story that tells about the kindness of neighboring ranch-hands, the use of old home remedies for illness, and how a family survived during terrible winters when food was in short supply.&#34;-Old West &#34;The character of Sarah Olds sets this story apart. With A.J. often bedridden, Sarah was on her own as much as not. It was usually she who had to make the dangerous journeys into Reno-a day&#39;s wagon ride over washboard roads-for necessary supplies. While she did her endless chores, she was chased by storms, blistered by heat, threatened by wild creatures great and small, let down by friends, and discouraged by local officials time and again. But she never failed her family.&#34; -Reno Evening Gazette</p><h2>The Millionaire Joshua: His Prosperity Secrets for You!

Highly respected scholar Mark Boda shows how three creedal expressions--the narrative, character, and relational creeds--recur throughout the Old Testament and express its core redemptive theology, in turn revealing how the redemptive pulse of God expands to all of creation. He also traces these redemptive and creational pulses into the New Testament and shows their relevance for today&#39;s Christian community.</p><p><i>The Heartbeat of Old Testament Theology</i> is part of the <b>Acadia Studies in Bible and Theology </b>series. The series editor is Craig&nbsp;A. Evans.<br><br>"Boda has demonstrated great insight and learning in his numerous previous publications. In <i>The Heartbeat of Old Testament Theology</i>, he now illumines the overall theological message of the Old Testament. This book is must reading for all serious students of the Bible."<br>--<b>Tremper Longman&nbsp;III</b>, Westmont College<br><br>"Wonderfully grounded in close readings of biblical texts, this work is an impressive presentation of key theological trajectories that reveal the person and acts of God across the canon. Boda explores what he labels the narrative, character, and relational creeds of Israel and then connects them to the redemptive purposes for all of creation. His carefully articulated method establishes the Old Testament's own voice before demonstrating its rich and complex ties to the New. Informed, creative, and robust, <i>The Heartbeat of Old Testament Theology</i> is an important contribution!"<br>--<b>M.&nbsp;Daniel Carroll&nbsp;R. (Rodas)</b>, Wheaton College and Graduate School<br><br>"Boda, who has penned a number of important biblical-theological studies, here demonstrates his considerable control of the biblical texts in pursuit of what he calls the heartbeat of Old Testament theology. The result is a useful presentation of three creedal rhythms: narrative, character, and relational. Not content to restrict the discussion to the Old Testament, Boda also relates these rhythms to the New Testament and to Christian life more broadly. A sermon and a lengthy appendix round out the volume and show his ideas at work and in action."<br>--<b>Brent&nbsp;A. Strawn</b>, Emory University<br><br>"Boda has written a contemporary Old Testament theology worth reading--learned, reflective, insightful, and relevant. His emphasis on the creedal affirmations that constitute the 'pulse' for theological formulation links back to the fountain of Gerhard von Rad but carries that proposal forward for today. Students and ministers alike will benefit from this work, and it is one I warmly commend."<br>--<b>Heath&nbsp;A. Thomas</b>, Oklahoma Baptist University<b>Mark J.

Crumb&#39;s Legendary Humor Comics Anthology</h2><p>The Book of Weirdo is the definitive (as well as hugely entertaining) examination of Weirdo magazine, renowned underground comix cartoonist Robert Crumb's legendary humor comics anthology from the 1980s. Crumb himself has called the retrospective &#x201c;a great book&#x201d; and &#x201c;the definitive work on the subject.&#x201d;<br><br>A "low-brow" counterpoint to Art Spiegelman and Francoise Mouly's rather high-falootin&#x2019; RAW, Weirdo influenced an entire generation of cartoonists, and served as a creative refuge for underground comix veterans and training ground for new creators, and this book features the comprehensive story of the fondly-recalled magazine, along with testimonials from over 130 of the mag's contributors, plus interviews with Weirdo&#x2019;s three editors &#x2015; R. &#x201c;Keep on Truckin&#x2019;&#x201d; Crumb, Peter &#x201c;Hate&#x201d; Bagge, and Aline &#x201c;The Bunch&#x201d; Kominsky-Crumb &#x2015; as well as publisher &#x201c;Baba Ron&#x201d; Turner.<br><br>This 288-page hardcover book is as much a comprehensive history of the alternative comics scene of the 1980s and early &#x2019;90s &#x2015; from New York City punk to Seattle grunge &#x2015; as it is the story of a single magazine, an exhaustive retrospective that includes rare and unseen artwork from that era, as well as new comics from modern-day artists paying homage to the great oddball mag. In its time, the periodical featured the finest work of many artists, particularly the best material by R. Crumb himself, Weirdo's founder and best known for ZAP Comix, Fritz the Cat, and Mr. Natural, and a man widely heralded as the greatest cartoonist of all time.<br><br>In 1981, amidst a seismic shift to the right in the country, Crumb responded by unleashing the savagely irreverent and satirical Weirdo onto the great multitude, and he generously welcomed to its pages not just his ZAP Comix underground cohorts, but also an entirely new generation of iconoclastic cartoonists. It was an irreverent, outrageous, often politically-incorrect, and taboo-challenging anthology that showcased Crumb's finest &#x2015; and most controversial &#x2015; material. It was gut-busting, hysterical, and frequently offensive. But, most of all, it was FUNNY! Though it finally gave up the ghost by 1993, in its time, Weirdo was one of the very best of its kind... a showcase for outsiders, freaks, and (naturally) weirdos.

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. In this title Kandinsky analyzed the geometrical elements which make up every painting-the point and the line. He called the physical support and the material surface on which the artist draws or paints the basic plane, or BP. He did not analyze them objectively, but from the point of view of their inner effect on the observer. A point is a small bit of color put by the artist on the canvas. It is neither a geometric point nor a mathematical abstraction; it is extension, form and color. This form can be a square, a triangle, a circle, a star or something more complex. The point is the most concise form but, according to its placement on the basic plane, it will take a different tonality. It can be isolated or resonate with other points or lines. A line is the product of a force which has been applied in a given direction: the force exerted on the pencil or paintbrush by the artist. The produced linear forms may be of several types: a straight line, which results from a unique force applied in a single direction; an angular line, resulting from the alternation of two forces in different directions, or a curved (or wave-like) line, produced by the effect of two forces acting simultaneously. The book contains many photographic examples and drawings from Kandinsky&#39;s works which offer the demonstration of its theoretical observations, and which allow the reader to experience the inner effect of the point and line to plane.</p><p></p><h2>The Open Heart Club: A Story about Birth and Death and Cardiac Surgery</h2><p><b>This absorbing and poignant book is not merely the story of one writer's flawed heart. It is a history of cardiac medicine, a candid personal journey, and a profound reflection on mortality.</b><b><br></b>Born in 1966 with a congenital heart defect known as the tetralogy of Fallot, Gabriel Brownstein entered the world just as doctors were learning to operate on conditions like his. He received a life-saving surgery at five years old, and since then has ridden wave after wave of medical innovation, a series of interventions that have kept his heart beating.<br><i>The Open Heart Club</i> is both a memoir of a life on the edge of medicine's reach and a history of the remarkable people who have made such a life possible. It begins with the visionary anatomists of the seventeenth century, tells the stories of the doctors (all women) who invented pediatric cardiology, and includes the lives of patients and physicians struggling to understand the complexities of the human heart. <i>The Open Heart Club</i> is a riveting work of compassionate storytelling, a journey into the dark hinterlands between sickness and health lit by bright moments of humor and inspiration.</p><p><b>Gabriel Brownstein </b>has published a novel, <i>The Man from Beyond</i>, and a book of stories, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Apt. 3W. For his short fiction, he has won a PEN/Hemingway Award and a Pushcart Prize. He teaches at St. John's University in Queens, New York, and lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two daughters."A compelling plunge into a dark subject by one of the most engagingly honest and warmly sympathetic narrators you'll ever meet."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Phillip Lopate, author of <i>To Show and to Tell</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Open Heart Club</i> is a truly heartrending story of one man's lifelong struggle with heart disease, backed up with a powerfully well written history of the people whose discoveries have kept him alive."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Mimi Swartz, author of <i>Ticker: The Quest to Create an Artificial Heart</i></b></i></b><br><br>"This is an extraordinary book, one that artfully weaves Brownstein's poignant personal recollections together with a fascinating history of ideas and innovations that have ushered in the era of modern surgery. Anyone who cares about medicine, technology, longevity-or the human heart-needs to read this."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jon Gertner, author of <i>The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Surgery is a miracle. It's easy to forget how radical it is for a doctor to cut into our bodies, make repairs, and close us up again. Life, too, is miraculous, and this is also easy to forget as we go about our daily lives. <i>The Open Heart Club</i> is a tribute to both. This is the story of one man's life and Life itself. Meticulously researched and written with beauty and wonder, this is a story that will make you marvel at every beat of your own open heart."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Tayari Jones, author of <i>An American Marriage</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[An] engaging account of his uncertain life...Brownstein's warmth and candor will keep readers immersed in this tale of survival in a time of chronic illness."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Kirkus Reviews</b></i></i></b></p><h2>Four Faces of a Leader: What It Takes to Move Your Church Forward</h2><p>An engaging look at reality-based Christian leadership, <i>The Four Faces of a Leader</i> has the potential to utterly transform leaders and those they lead&#x2014;not with bells and whistles, but with a soft whisper of truth about servant leadership. By emphasizing the leadership priorities Jesus demonstrated in the gospels, Rhoden engages the reader with practical applications for all pastors, whether they serve 3,000 or 200 members. Like a personal mentor sharing valuable life lessons, this book challenges, inspires, informs, and encourages.

This, Nora realizes, is her life: nothing so simple, so vanilla, as a mere love triangle for her. It's a knot in a silken cord, a tangled mass of longings of the body and the heart and the mind. And it may unravel at any moment.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>But in Nora's world, no one is ever truly powerless&#x2014;a cadre of her friends, protectors and lovers stands ready to do anything to save her, even when the only certainty seems to be sacrifice and heartbreak....</p><p><b>Tiffany Reisz is a multi-award winning and bestselling author.

What else could explain the cold, industrial chair she sat in, the unforgiving metal of the handcuffs on her wrists and the terror in her heart?<br><br>Inside her aching and addled mind, Eleanor Schreiber opened her eyes and raised her head. Across from her in the interrogation room at the police station sat the new priest at Sacred Heart&#x2014;3:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning and here he was before her, a mere twenty-nine years old in the face but with eyes ancient enough they'd probably seen Christ in the flesh. She kind of hoped he had. She'd always wondered how tall Jesus was.<br><br>The priest&#x2014;Father Stearns to the church but Soren to her&#x2014;said nothing. He merely stared at her with a little smile lurking on his lips. At least someone was enjoying her misery. Where was her father? Her dad should be here now. She needed her father, not her Father. Her dad was the reason she'd ended up arrested in Manhattan in the hours before dawn. But no, she only had her priest and the desire to wipe the smile off that perfect face of his.<br><br>"So I've been meaning to ask you..." She decided to take control of the moment and be the first to break the silence. "Are you one of those priests who fucks the kids in the congregation?"<br><br>Whatever reaction she'd hoped for from her priest, she didn't get it.<br><br>"No."<br><br>Eleanor took a deep breath and exhaled heavily through her nose. "Too bad."<br><br>"Eleanor, perhaps we should discuss the predicament you're in at the moment."<br><br>"I'm in a real pickle." She nodded, hoping to annoy him. A useless plan. They'd met twice before tonight and she'd done her damnedest to get under his skin both times. No dice. He'd treated her with kindness and respect both times. She wasn't used to that.<br><br>"You were arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto. Supposedly five luxury vehicles with a combined value of over a quarter of a million dollars have disappeared from Manhattan tonight. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"<br><br>"I take the fifth. That's what I'm supposed to say, right?"<br><br>"To the court, yes. To me, you will tell the truth always."<br><br>"I don't think you want to know the truth about me, Soren," she said, her voice not much more than a whisper. She wasn't stupid. She only had to look at him to know that he and she had nothing in common. He looked liked money, talked like money. He had the whitest fingernails she'd ever seen and hands that belonged on a statue or something. All of him looked like a work of art&#x2014;his hands, his face and lips, his height and beauty.... And here she was, chipped black nail polish, wet from the rain she'd been arrested in, hair falling in lank waves into her face, her school uniform a sodden mess, no money, no hope, and her whole life a fucking train wreck.<br><br>"There is nothing I don't want to know about you," Soren said, and seemed to mean it. "And I assure you, nothing you tell me will shock or disgust me. Nothing will make me change my mind about you."<br><br>"Change your mind? You've already made up your mind about me? What's the verdict?"<br><br>"The verdict is simply this&#x2014;I am willing and capable of helping you out of this mess you've gotten yourself into."<br><br>"Can we call it a 'pickle'? Pickle sounds less scary than mess."<br><br>"It's a disaster, young lady. You could easily spend years in juvenile detention for what you did tonight. One of the cars you stole belonged to someone important and influential, and he's apparently determined that you don't see sunlight until age twenty-one. Keeping you out of juvenile detention will take a great deal of doing on my part. Blessedly, I have some connections. Or, more accurately, I have someone who has connections. The time and expense will be considerable," he said in a tone that seemed to imply he relished the time and expense, which made no sense. But nothing about the man or his interest in her made any sense at all.<br><br>"And you'll go to all this trouble for me...why?" Eleanor lifted her head a little higher and stared straight into his eyes.<br><br>"Because there is nothing I wouldn't do to protect you, Eleanor. Nothing I wouldn't do to help you. And nothing I wouldn't do to save you. Nothing."<br><br>A chill passed through Eleanor's whole body. Someone walked over her grave, as her grandmother would say. She never understood that phrase, that feeling before. Now she did.<br><br>"But my assistance doesn't come without a price."<br><br>"Right." Eleanor smirked at him. "So this is when we get back to my first question and the fucking of the kids at church. Oh, well, if you insist."<br><br>"Do you value your worth as a child of God so little that you think the only thing I could possibly want from you is sex?"<br><br>The question hit Eleanor so hard she almost flinched. But she wouldn't let him see he'd gotten to her. Her mom would disown her for this. Her dad was probably eight states away by now. Her grandparents were seven minutes from death. Her entire future was about six feet under. Still she wasn't about to let anyone take away her pride. She at least had that. For now, anyway.<br><br>"So that's a no?"<br><br>Soren raised his eyebrow at her and she almost giggled. She was beginning to like this guy. She'd fallen in love with him already&#x2014;utterly, completely and until the end of the world or even after. Never guessed she'd end up liking him, too.<br><br>"That would be a no. I will require something of you, however, in exchange for my assistance."<br><br>"Do you always talk like this?"<br><br>"You mean articulately?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Weird. So what price am I paying? Hope it's not my firstborn child. Don't want kids."<br><br>"My price is simply this&#x2014;in exchange for my assistance, I only ask that you do what I tell you to do from now on."<br><br>"Do what you tell me to do?"<br><br>"Yes. I want you to obey me."<br><br>"From now on? Like...how long?"<br><br>And he smiled then and she knew she should have been afraid but something in that smile. It was the first time that night she felt safe. "Forever."<br><br><em>"Wake up, Sleeping Beauty."</em><br><br>She heard a voice tinged with a French accent and tried to ignore it as she always tried to ignore French-accented voices. The last thing Nora wanted to do was wake up. In her dream she was with Soren and he was twenty-nine and she fifteen and their story had only begun. And she knew if she opened her eyes, she could very well be facing the end of their story. She wanted to stay in her dream and would have stayed in it forever but for the cold, delicate fingers dancing across her face like spider legs.<br><br>Nora opened her eyes.<br>The Kingsley Edge stood in front of the mirror in his large walk-in closet studying his wounds as he changed from his torn shirt into another. The layers of marble-colored bruises Soren had left on him after their one night together had already turned from red to black. He could have hated the priest for the reminders upon his body of a night he feared would never be repeated. Still, he cherished the bruises now as much as he did when they were boys at school. Far more than the scars on his chest, gifts from enemies with guns, he wore them as badges of honor.<br><br>He raised his hand to the worst of his old wounds&#x2014;a scar on the left side of his chest a few inches below his heart. A strange injury that looked more like he'd been stabbed than shot. Who knows? Maybe he had been.<br><br>The mission that had left him with that scar, with two of his four bullet wounds, he remembered almost nothing of. His mind had buried the memory, and he had no desire to dig it back up. Waking up in the hospital in Paris. That moment he would never forget. He would probably think of it on his deathbed. That hospital bed...it should have been his deathbed, could have been. But for the visitor.<br><br>He had come to consciousness slowly, arduously, crawling through the deep dark on his way back into the light. He had dragged himself up through the trench of drugs and pain, bitter pain and the failure of the mission. Sensing white light in the room, he'd kept his eyes closed, unable yet to confront the sun.<br><br>From over his shoulder he'd heard low voices&#x2014;one female, crisp and careful, and one male, authoritative and unyielding.<br><br>"He will live," the man's voice said in French. It wasn't a question he asked the woman, but an order given.<br><br>"We'll do what we can for him, of course." Of course, she said. <em>Bien sut.</em> But Kingsley had heard the lie in her voice.<br><br>"You will do everything for him. Everything. From this moment on he is your only patient. He is your only concern."<br><br><em>"Oui, mon pete. Mais..."</em> Mais...but... Her voice betrayed her fear. <em>Mon pete?</em> Kingsley's muddled mind had tried to wrap itself around the words. His father had been dead for years. Who was the father she spoke to?<br><br>"Consider his life as precious as your own. Do you understand that?"<br><br>There it was. Kingsley would have smiled in his half sleep were it not for the tubes down his throat. He knew a death threat when he heard it. <em>Consider his life as precious as yout own....</em> That was French anyone could translate. <em>He lives and you live. He dies and...</em><br><br>But who cared enough about him anymore to make even an idle threat? When joining <em>le Legion</em> he'd put one name down on his next-of-kin line. One name. The only family he had left. And yet, he wasn't family, not at all. Why would he of all people come to him now?<br><br>"He will live," the woman had promised, and this time she spoke no <em>"mais."</em><br><br>"Good. Spare no expense for his comfort and health. All will be accounted for."<br><br>The nurse, or perhaps she was a doctor, had sworn again she would do everything. She'd pledged that the patient would walk out whole and healthy. She'd promised she would do all she could and then some. Smart woman.<br><br>Kingsley heard her high heels retreating on the tile, the sound of her shoes as crisp and efficient as her voice. The sound died and Kingsley knew he and the visitor were now alone in the room. He struggled to open his eyes but couldn't find the strength.<br><br>"Rest, Kingsley," came the voice again. And he felt a hand on his forehead, gentle as a lover's, tender as a father's.<br><br>"My Kingsley..." The voice sighed and Kingsley heard frustration mixed with amusement. Amusement or something like it. "Forgive me for saying this, but I think it's time you find a new hobby."<br><br>And even with the tubes in his throat, Kingsley had managed a smile.<br><br>The hand left his face and he felt something against his fingers. The dark came upon him again, but it wasn't the deep dark this time, merely sleep, and when he awoke again the tube was gone and he could see and speak and breathe again. And the thing that had touched his fingers was an envelope containing paperwork for a Swiss bank account someone had opened in his name&#x2014;a Swiss bank account that contained roughly thirty-three million American dollars.<br><br>He took the money and he took the advice of his one and only hospital visitor. He returned to America, to the country where he'd once experienced true happiness.<br><br>And in America he did as he'd been ordered.<br><br>He found a new hobby.<br><br>Kingsley finished dressing. He tucked his shirt in and pulled on and buttoned his embroidered black-and-silver vest. Once more he looked dashing and roguish all at the same time. The household knew something had happened and for their sake he would act the part of their fearless leader as always if only to comfort their minds. In truth, he'd never been so scared in his life, not even that day in the hospital.<br><br>He yanked on his jacket as he stepped away from the mirror. Never before had he dealt with a crisis of this magnitude in his world. As soon as he'd built his Underground, his Empire of S&amp;M clubs that catered to the wealthy and the powerful as well as the scared and the shamed, he'd begun stockpiling blackmail fodder on all the police chiefs and politicians, on the media and the Mafia, anyone who could potentially threaten his borders. Now the thing he'd feared most, harm&#x2014;real harm to a citizen of his kingdom&#x2014;had befallen them. And he had only himself to blame.<br><br>As soon as he left his bedroom, his night secretary, Sophie, met him in the hallway. She rattled off half a dozen messages and meetings.<br><br>"Cancel all the meetings," he ordered as they reached the stairs. "Ignore the messages."<br><br><em>"Oui, monsieut.</em> Master Fiske is in your office." Good. Griffin was on time today.<br><br>He dismissed Sophie and headed to his private office on the third floor. When he reached it, he found Griffin standing by the window talking in hushed tones to the young man with him. Kingsley watched them a moment, waiting for them to notice him. But they had been afflicted with the tunnel vision of new love. Griffin raised his hand and cupped the face of Michael, his new lover. One kiss turned into a second one followed by a whisper. Michael nodded and leaned into Griffin, and when Michael's silver eyes finally looked at something other than Griffin, Kingsley saw the terror in them. He could sympathize.<br><br>"You should have left your pet at home," Kingsley said, unable to resist goading Griffin.<br><br></p><h2>Toast: The Story of a Boy&#39;s Hunger</h2><p><b>Toast</b> is Nigel Slater&#x2019;s truly extraordinary story of a childhood remembered through food.

He graduated from the Musashino Art University. In 2007, he debuted with Gakusatsu Kikan(Genocidal Organs), and took first prize of the &#x201c;Best SF of 2007&#x201d; in SF Magazine. He is also the author of Metal Gear Solid: Guns of the Patriots, a Japanerse-language novel based on the popular video game series. After a long battle with cancer, Itoh passed away in March 2009. Harmony was revised by Itoh while in the hospital, receiving treatment for the disease.Gr 9 Up-Itoh ups the dystopian-fiction ante considerably by including a backstory, main plot, and postcript, each of which is disturbing in its own way. In Japan, Tuan Kirie and her friends Miach Mihie and Cian Reikado are taught about a period called the Maelstrom during which nuclear bombs and diseases ran rampant and destroyed the country once known as the United States of America. A horror of disease has driven the older generation to remake society, replacing nation-states with smaller &#34;admedistrations,&#34; organizational bodies that use nanotech &#34;medicules&#34; and societal pressure to ensure that each person is as healthy as possible. The three teenagers, led by Miach, attempt to use this technology to commit suicide and thus rob society of valuable resources-their own lives. Miach is successful but Cian reveals the plot and she and Tuan are saved. Thirteen years later, Tuan continues to rebel, even while she attains a high-level position in the international medical police corps. It is under this aegis that she investigates when Cian commits suicide (one of thousands, worldwide). During her search, Tuan discovers that there may be something even more repugnant than a world of perfectly healthy people. Itoh presents a future in which humanity willingly collaborates in its own subjugation to &#34;medical correctness.&#34; Fans of Orwell and Westerfeld will find this novel intriguing.-Eric Norton, McMillan Memorial Library, Wisconsin Rapids, WI (c) Copyright 2010.

Its creation amplified already tense relationships between the government, settlers, and the Creek Nation, culminating in the devastating Creek War of 1813&#x2013;1814, and thereafter it became the primary avenue of immigration for thousands of Alabama settlers.<br><br> Central to understanding Alabama&#x2019;s territorial and early statehood years, the Federal Road was both a physical and symbolic thoroughfare that cut a swath of shattering change through the land and cultures it traversed. The road revolutionized Alabama&#x2019;s expansion, altering the course of its development by playing a significant role in sparking a cataclysmic war, facilitating unprecedented American immigration, and enabling an associated radical transformation of the land itself.<br><br> The first half of <i>The Old Federal Road in Alabama: An Illustrated Guide</i> offers a narrative history that includes brief accounts of the construction of the road, the experiences of historic travelers, and descriptions of major changes to the road over time. The authors vividly reconstruct the course of the road in detail and make use of a wealth of well-chosen illustrations. Along the way they give attention to the very terrain it traversed, bringing to life what traveling the road must have been like and illuminating its story in a way few others have ever attempted.<br><br> The second half of the volume is divided into three parts&#x2014;Eastern, Central, and Southern&#x2014;and serves as a modern traveler&#x2019;s guide to the Federal Road.

Whether they bind computers, economies, or terrorist organizations, networks are everywhere in the real world, yet only recently have scientists attempted to explain their mysterious workings.</p><p>From epidemics of disease to outbreaks of market madness, from people searching for information to firms surviving crisis and change, from the structure of personal relationships to the technological and social choices of entire societies, Watts weaves together a network of discoveries across an array of disciplines to tell the story of an explosive new field of knowledge, the people who are building it, and his own peculiar path in forging this new science.</p></p><p>You may be only six degrees away from Kevin Bacon, but would he let you borrow his car? It depends on the structures within the network that links you. When the power goes out, when we find that a stranger knows someone we know, when dot-com stocks soar in price, networks are evident. In <i>Six Degrees</i>, sociologist Duncan Watts examines networks like these: what they are, how they're being studied, and what we can use them for. To illustrate the often complicated mathematics that describe such structures, Watts uses plenty of examples from life, without which this book would quickly move beyond a general science readership. Small chapters make each thought-provoking conclusion easy to swallow, though some are hard to digest. For instance, in a short bit on "coercive externalities," Watts sums up sociological research showing that: <p> </p><blockquote>"Conversations concerning politics displayed a consistent pattern .... On election day, the strongest predictor of electoral success was not which party an individual privately supported but which party he or she expected would win."</blockquote> <p></p> <i>Six Degrees</i> attempts to help readers understand the new and exciting field of networks and complexity. While considerably more demanding than a general book like <i>The Tipping Point</i>, it offers readers a snapshot of a riveting moment in science, when understanding things like disease epidemics and the stock market seems almost within our reach. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><strong>Duncan J.

It shows how their ideas took shape and changed as they engaged with each other and eventually began to have serious debates and arguments. <em>Original Intents </em>shows that there was no single original meaning or intent in the Constitution, and that Hamilton sought to build a Republican United States that was completely incompatible with the Republic that Jefferson and Madison wanted. By the early 1790s, the two Virginians had come to despise Hamilton and detest his vision, and vice versa.<br></p><p><br><strong>Andrew Shankman</strong> is Associate Professor of History at Rutgers University, Camden.<br><br>"<em>Original Intents</em> greatly clarifies our understanding of Hamilton and his financial system and explains more clearly than ever before why Jefferson and Madison so strongly opposed him and his system."--Gordon S.

In lively and clear language, he illuminates how fragile the new republic appeared to America's founding generation. By bringing the founders' concerns to life and exposing their differences, Shankman lays out the origins of debates over government and equality, which Americans continue to wrestle with today."--Johann N. Neem, author of <em>Creating a Nation of Joiners</em> <br><p></p><br>"Hamilton vs. Jefferson: in some ways, their storied clash frames and explains the nation's first decade of constitutional governance. <em>Original Intents</em> examines this conflict as the two men and their mutual friend Madison experienced and understood it. Rather than dealing in vague generalities about idealistic visions, it offers a gripping ground-level view of a battle over the meaning and reach of the nation's new Constitution. Clear, concise, and rich in context without ever losing sight of the politics and personalities of its protagonists, <em>Original Intents</em> is sure to have both popular and classroom appeal. Anyone who seeks to understand the nation's founding and its lasting implications should read this book."--Joanne Freeman, <em>Yale University</em> <br><p></p><br>"Here is a handy book that calls our attention to the central debate in the American founding experience: what kind of country should the American people create? Patriotic narratives would have us believe that the answer was 'self-evident,' but nothing was farther from the truth. There had been many revolutions, several separate 'foundings,' and no shortage of reckless claims tossed off by friends and foes of the 1787 Constitution. The bitter quarrels between Hamilton and Jefferson, refereed or inflamed by an ever-thoughtful James Madison, framed profoundly different outcomes for the infant republic. Deftly sketching out this complicated Venn diagram of interests, ideals, hopes, and dreams, Andrew Shankman rightly concludes that neither side won--and we would be best served by ignoring claims to the contrary from either direction. Excellent history; excellent advice."--John L.

More than anything else, he was a man who wanted to improve the life of his fellow human beings through the advancement of all the sciences and the establishment of a stable and just political order. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Maria Rosa Antognazza outlines the central features of Leibniz's philosophy in the context of his overarching intellectual vision and aspirations. Against the backdrop of Leibniz's encompassing scientific ambitions, she introduces the fundamental principles of Leibniz's thought, as well as his theory of truth and theory of knowledge. Exploring Leibniz's contributions to logic, mathematics, physics, and metaphysics, she considers how his theories sat alongside his concerns with politics, diplomacy, and a broad range of practical reforms: juridical, economic, administrative, technological, medical, and ecclesiastical. Discussing Leinbniz's theories of possible worlds, she concludes by looking at what is ultimately real in this actual world that we experience, the good and evil there is in it, and Leibniz's response to the problem of evil through his theodicy. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Who or what was the real Real McCoy? And why do we call false sentiment crocodile tears? Can crocodiles really cry? In What Made the Crocodile Cry? , Susie Dent draws on her popular television segment on the curiosities of English to tackle these and many other fascinating puzzles. Writing with her customary charm and erudition, Dent offers a wonderfully readable and endlessly entertaining exploration of language, answering 101 of the most intriguing questions about the English language, from word origins and spelling to grammar and usage. Dent ranges far and wide in her search for the oddities of language, pondering the ancient origin of the word &#34;tragedy&#34; (which originally meant &#34;goat song&#34; in Greek) as well as the modern meaning of the word &#34;donk&#34; in the Blackout Crew&#39;s song title &#34;Put a Donk in It.&#34; And throughout, the book brims with fascinating tales. Readers learn, for instance, that the word &#34;bankrupt&#34; comes from the Italian &#34;banca rotta&#34; or &#34; broken bench&#34; and the word &#34;broke&#34; (meaning &#34;out of funds&#34;) has the same origin. Dent explains that in the sixteenth century, money lenders conducted their business on benches outdoors and the usual Italian word for &#34;bench&#34; was &#34;banca&#34; (hence today&#39;s &#34;bank&#34;). The author also provides an entertaining account of the origin of the term &#34;white elephant&#34; (meaning &#34;a useless, burdensome possession&#34;) that dates back to ancient Siam, where rare white elephants were always given to the king. But since by law white elephants couldn&#39;t be worked (and earn money) or even be ridden, the king often re-gifted these worthless burdens to courtiers whom he didn&#39;t like. Sparkling with insight and linguistic curiosity, this delightful compendium will be irresistible to anyone fascinated with language--the perfect gift for word lovers everywhere.</p><p><br><strong>Susie Dent</strong> is a writer and broadcaster, best known for being the regular face of Dictionary Corner on Channel 4 TV's Countdown.

From the author of the best-selling <i>The Mentor&#x2019;s Guide</i> comes the next-step mentoring resource to ensure personnel at all levels of an organization will teach and learn from each other. Written for anyone who wants to embed mentoring within their organization, <i>Creating a Mentoring Culture</i> is filled with step-by-step guidance, practical advice, engaging stories, and includes a wealth of reproducible forms and tools.</p><p><br> <br> <strong> Q&amp;A with the Author </strong> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author Lois Zachary</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong> What is a mentoring culture and why is it so important? </strong><br> Organizations that continuously create value for mentoring achieve amazing results. They report increased retention rates, improved morale, increased organizational commitment and job satisfaction, accelerated leadership development, better succession planning, reduced stress, stronger and more cohesive teams, and heightened individual and organizational learning. <br><br> Effective organizational mentoring can and does exist without the presence of an established mentoring culture but it requires considerable more time and effort to maintain and ensure programmatic growth and sustainability. A mentoring culture raises the bar of mentoring practice for everyone. Individual mentoring programs and relationships achieve greater long-term impact because the mentoring culture sustains a continuum of expectation, which, in turn, generates a standard and consistency of good mentoring practice. <br><br> There are eight hallmarks that contribute to creating a vibrant and full mentoring culture. Each hallmark is differentiated from the others, yet they are interdependent. The eight hallmarks &#x2014; accountability, alignment, communication, value and visibility, demand, multiple mentoring opportunities, education and training, and safety nets &#x2014; manifest themselves differently in each organization depending on the organization&#x2019;s current mentoring practices. In a mentoring culture all hallmarks are present, at least to some degree. The more consistently that the practices of each hallmark are present, the fuller and more robust the mentoring culture and the more sustainable it is likely to be. <br><br> <strong>What did you hope to accomplish by writing this book? </strong><br> I wrote this book for organizational leaders charged with strategic mentoring launch and implementation, change agents, mentoring leadership, mentoring program developers and administrators, program managers, staff developers, corporate HR learning and development departments, and mentoring task forces. My goal was to help my readers take mentoring in their organizations to the next level &#x2013; whether they were thinking about starting a new initiative, implementing an existing one, jump starting a stalled one, institutionalizing process improvements or keeping mentoring fresh and creative. I felt it was important to stimulate purposeful reflection and action and to raise the level of discourse and dialogue about mentoring in order to enhance organizational mentoring practices. <br><br> <strong>How does this book fit into the mentoring family of resources that you have written? </strong><br> My books, together with our Mentoring Excellence Toolkits, provide a comprehensive set of resources for promoting mentoring excellence within organizations. Creating a Mentoring Culture (2005) is a practical guide for thinking about mentoring from a broad and deep strategic perspective, for creating a culture in which mentoring is a well-honed and practiced competency. It is a guide to creating a culture in which mentoring lives as natural and normative-- and in which mentoring excellence is the standard of practice. The Mentee's Guide: Making Mentoring Work for You (2009), that I wrote with Lory Fischler, takes readers through all four phases of being a mentee and provides answers to many of the most frequently asked questions about how to make the most of a mentoring relationship, while providing strategies for success. The Mentor's Guide, 2nd Edition (2012) provides the framework needed to help other successfully navigate their journey &#x2013; no matter what career, profession or educational setting the mentee is situated in. <br> <br><p><b>CREATING A MENTORING CULTURE</b> </p><p>In order to succeed in today's competitive environment, corporate and nonprofit institutions must create a workplace climate that encourages employees to continue to learn and grow.

But have you ever actually seen five-paragraph essays outside of school walls? Have you ever found it in business writing, journalism, nonfiction, or any other genres that exist in the real world? Kimberly Hill Campbell and Kristi Latimer reviewed the research on the effectiveness of the form as a teaching tool and discovered that the research does not support the five-paragraph formula. In fact, research shows that the formula restricts creativity, emphasizes structure rather than content, does not improve standardized test scores, inadequately prepares students for college writing, and results in vapid writing. In <i>Beyond the Five-Paragraph Essay</i>, Kimberly and Kristi show you how to reclaim the literary essay and create a program that encourages thoughtful writing in response to literature. They provide numerous strategies that stimulate student thinking, value unique insight, and encourage lively, personal writing, including the following:</p><ul> <li>Close reading (which is the basis for writing about literature)</li> <li>Low-stakes writing options that support students' thinking as they read</li> <li>Collaboration in support of discussion, debate, and organizational structures that support writing as exploration</li> <li>A focus on students' writing process as foundational to content development and structure</li> <li>The use of model texts to write in the form of the literature students are reading and analyzing</li></ul><p>The goal of reading and writing about literature is to push and challenge our students' thinking. We want students to know that their writing can convey something important: a unique view to share, defend, prove, delight, discover, and inspire. If we want our students to be more engaged, skilled writers, we need to move beyond the five-paragraph essay.</p></p><p><p>Kimberly Hill Campbell had a bit of a bumpy start as a beginning teacher. She taught language arts at Estacada Junior High School from 1979 until 1982. "Then," she says, "I became the statistic: a beginning teacher who left the profession. I was frustrated that I had no voice about the curriculum in my classroom."</p><p>So she turned to law and received her J.D. from Willamette University College of Law and practiced law and taught in the legal assistant program at the community college level until 1986. She returned to teaching at Estacada High School in 1987. "I found my voice as a teacher through teacher research of my own practice and the research and writing of language arts teachers such as Nancie Atwell and Tom Romano."</p><p>Kimberly received her M.A.T. degree from Lewis &amp; Clark College in secondary language arts and administration in 1994, and in 1995 she was the founding principal of Riverdale High School, a small high school based on the principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools.</p><p>She is currently assistant professor in the M.A.T. program at Lewis &amp; Clark College. Her primary forcus is working with beginning teachers who want to be middle school and high school language arts teachers. She also teaches classes in teacher research and language arts methods for inservice teachers.</p><p>Kimberly says that she always wanted to become a teacher. "I made my younger sister and her friends play school with me. Teaching language arts allowed me to weave my love of teaching with my love of literature and writing. It was surprising to me to discover that many of my students did not share my passion for literature and writing. Finding ways to invite students to discover the power of words is my continuing challenge."</p><p>"I love the complexity of teaching. The more I practice teaching and study the craft of teaching, the more respect I have for the work. Teaching requires a keen eye, an attentive ear, a commitment to knowing each of my students well, a willingness to share myself as a reader and writer, and the unwavering belief that I'll find a way to reach each student if I just keep trying. Although it's not always easy to see, the moment when a student, in middle school, high school, or graduate school, learns something new, is nothing short of magic. It's sheer joy to witness. I also appreciate how teaching provides me with the opportunity to learn from and with students."</p><p>Kimberly's book,&nbsp;<i>Less Is More</i>, was inspired by her son, John, as well as the middle school and high school students who helped her discover that classroom literature could and should include more than just novels. "I drew on the journals and student work samples I kept from my own experiences as a high school teacher, as well my observations in the classrooms of student teachers and graduates. Writing the book gave me permission to lose myself in reading wonderful short texts. I followed up on the recommendations from my own children, my students, and colleagues who generously shared their short text recommendations and teaching strategies."</p><p>Kimberly's own professional development is supported by reading and writing. "I am grateful for the authors who have informed and inspired my work by sharing their stories and discoveries as teachers. I enjoy being part of professional development opportunities that provide time for teachers to write and read the stories of other teachers, as well as their own.</p><p>Kimberly's greatest hobby is reading and she is trying her hand at writing a mystery novel. She also enjoys watching movies, shopping, and swimming. She was born in sunny Denver, CO, but moved to rainy Oregon. "I found rain was the weather I needed to savor reading and thinking, although I still enjoy summer visits to my beautiful home state of Colorado. She lives with her husband, Michael, and she has two children, John and Kinsey.</p>"Teachers discouraged by the lack of original thought and creativity in student writing will value Campbell and Latimer&#x2019;s insightful book for providing a process, plan and alternative writing formats that breathe life back into student writing." - MiddleWeb<br><br><br>"It provides keys to producing creative writing outside the formula box, and is a fine primer for any educator's collection." - <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br><br>"They offer strategies and suggestions for facilitating thoughtful reading, creative writing, and critical thinking.&#x201d; - <i>Book News</i><br></p><h2>The Book Business: What Everyone Needs to Know�</h2><p>Many of us read books every day, either electronically or in print. We remember the books that shaped our ideas about the world as children, go back to favorite books year after year, give or lend books to loved ones and friends to share the stories we've loved especially, and discuss important books with fellow readers in book clubs and online communities. But for all the ways books influence us, teach us, challenge us, and connect us, many of us remain in the dark as to where they come from and how the mysterious world of publishing truly works. How are books created and how do they get to readers? <br><br><em>The Book Business: What Everyone Needs to Know�</em> introduces those outside the industry to the world of book publishing. Covering everything from the beginnings of modern book publishing early in the 20th century to the current concerns over the alleged death of print, digital reading, and the rise of Amazon, Mike Shatzkin and Robert Paris Riger provide a succinct and insightful survey of the industry in an easy-to-read question-and-answer format. The authors, veterans of "trade publishing," or the branch of the business that puts books in our hands through libraries or bookstores, answer questions from the basic to the cutting-edge, providing a guide for curious beginners and outsiders. How does book publishing actually work? What challenges is it facing today? How have social media changed the game of book marketing? What does the life cycle of a book look like in 2019? They focus on how practices are changing at a time of great flux in the industry, as digital creation and delivery are altering the commercial realities of the book business. <br><br>This book will interest not only those with no experience in publishing looking to gain a foothold on the business, but also those working on the inside who crave a bird's eye view of publishing's evolving landscape.

Current approaches tend to rely on policies crafted at the state or national level, which on their own have proved insufficient to arrest water scarcity. To be durable and effective, water plans must be informed by the culture, economics, and varied needs of affected community members.<br> &nbsp;<br> International water expert Brian Richter argues that sustainable water sharing in the twenty-first century can only happen through open, democratic dialogue and local collective action. In <i>Chasing Water</i>, Richter tells a cohesive and complete story of water scarcity: where it is happening, what is causing it, and how it can be addressed. Through his engaging and nontechnical style, he strips away the complexities of water management to its bare essentials, providing information and practical examples that will empower community leaders, activists, and students to develop successful and long-lasting water programs.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Chasing Water</i> will provide local stakeholders with the tools and knowledge they need to take an active role in the watershed-based planning and implementation that are essential for water supplies to remain sustainable in perpetuity.</p><p>Brian Richter is director of Global Freshwater Strategies for the Nature Conservancy, where he promotes sustainable water use and management with governments, corporations, and local communities. <br>"This is a book of balance&#x2014;delivered with appreciated measures of integrity and clarity."

Despite the glowing opportunities that many families associate with suburban schooling, accessing a district's resources is not always straightforward, particularly for black and poorer families. Moving beyond class- and race-based explanations, <i>Inequality in the Promised Land</i> focuses on the everyday interactions between parents, students, teachers, and school administrators in order to understand why resources seldom trickle down to a district's racial and economic minorities. Rolling Acres Public Schools (RAPS) is one of the many well-appointed suburban school districts across the United States that has become increasingly racially and economically diverse over the last forty years. Expanding on Charles Tilly's model of relational analysis and drawing on 100 in-depth interviews as well participant observation and archival research, R. L'Heureux Lewis-McCoy examines the pathways of resources in RAPS. He discovers that&#x2015;due to structural factors, social and class positions, and past experiences&#x2015;resources are not valued equally among families and, even when deemed valuable, financial factors and issues of opportunity hoarding often prevent certain RAPS families from accessing that resource. In addition to its fresh and incisive insights into educational inequality, this groundbreaking book also presents valuable policy-orientated solutions for administrators, teachers, activists, and politicians.</p><p>R. L&#39;Heureux Lewis-McCoy is Associate Professor of Sociology and Black Studies at The City College of New York."The book is a worthwhile read for researchers, stakeholders and activists, who should reflect on the ways that other districts may share some of these dynamics of inequality."&nbsp;-<i>Poverty &amp; Race Research Action Council </i><br><br> "...He offers an unusual glimpse into the obstacles that black suburban parents face as they seek to work with public school staff and other parents to support their children's learning.... The book is a welcome addition to current scholarship on suburban schooling and racial inequality and will be an appreciated and engaging resource for researchers, parents, and policy makers." -American Journal of Sociology<br> &nbsp;<br></p><h2>Preventing Challenging Behavior in Your Classroom: Positive Behavior Support and Effective Classroom Management</h2><p>&#34;Preventing Challenging Behavior in Your Classroom: Positive Behavior Support and Effective Classroom Management&#34; focuses on practical strategies to prevent and reduce behavior problems and enhance student learning, particularly Positive Behavior Support (PBS).

Scholarship in Animal Studies draws on a variety of methodologies to explore these multi-faceted relationships in order to help us understand the ways in which other animals figure in our lives and we in theirs. <br> <br> Bringing together the work of a group of internationally distinguished scholars, the contribution in <i>Critical Terms for Animal Studies</i> offers distinct voices and diverse perspectives, exploring significant concepts and asking important questions. How do we take non-human animals seriously, not simply as metaphors for human endeavors, but as subjects themselves? What do we mean by <i>anthropocentrism</i>, <i>captivity</i>, <i>empathy</i>, <i>sanctuary</i>, and <i>vulnerability</i>, and what work do these and other critical terms do in Animal Studies?<br> <br> Sure to become an indispensable reference for the field, <i>Critical Terms for Animal Studies</i> not only provides a framework for thinking about animals as subjects of their own experiences, but also serves as a touchstone to help us think differently about our conceptions of what it means to be human, and the impact human activities have on the more than human world.</p></p><p><b>Lori Gruen </b>is William Griffin Professor of Philosophy at Wesleyan University. She is the author of <i>Ethics and Animals</i> and <i>Entangled Empathy</i> and the editor of five other books."Lori Gruen has created an intellectual cafe in which leading scholars offer their insight and wisdom, in incisive and stimulating entries, on topics central to animal studies, all the while incorporating intersections with feminist, postcolonial, disability, environmental, and anti-racist scholarship. Richly textured, inviting and empowering, this is a dream book for students, academics, and activists alike." (<i>Carol J. Adams, author of The Sexual Politics of Meat and Burger</i>)<br><br>"Lori Gruen, who is herself at the forefront of animal studies, has rounded up the leading scholars in the field, and together they have produced a text that will define the field for the next generation." (<i>Dale Jamieson, New York University</i>)<br><br>"This book's standout feature is its analysis of animal studies terms across a wide array of disciplines and theoretical perspectives, ranging from anthropology and activism to biology and law. Although animal studies has been interdisciplinary from its beginnings, this volume considerably expands and deepens that interdisciplinary vision. Lori Gruen is a highly-recognized and well-respected scholar in the field and has brought together a superb mix of authors who represent the very best of the established discourse and the most exciting members of the new generation." (<i>Matthew Calarco, California State University, Fullerton</i>)<br><br>"This volume provides an&nbsp;overview of the some of the most central&#x2014;and some of the most contested&#x2014;concepts in the rapidly emerging inter-disciplinary area of animal studies. Unlike handbooks and readers, <i>Critical Terms for Animal Studies</i> is not focused on a selection of definitive texts but rather on setting the terms of the language used in the field. The subject of animal studies is at a crucial stage, still being mapped out and defining itself, and this volume is very useful, given its conciseness, its all-star cast of contributors, and its breadth in providing a guide to some of the key ideas. Taken along with the editor&#x2019;s introduction, which nicely situates the history of animal studies and lays out some vital strands and debates, I think many animal studies scholars will see this book as an anchor text.&#x201d; (<i>Colin Jerolmack, New York University</i>)<br><br><p>"This is the latest in Chicago's 'Critical Terms'&nbsp;series, containing an introduction and 29 contributed chapters edited by philosophy scholar Lori Gruen, who has published widely on ethics issues. Among the contributing authors to this volume are names familiar to academicians across disciplines, such as Peter Singer, Will Kymlicka, Barbara King, and Christine Korsgaard, as well as many others who represent the new generation of scholars in the burgeoning field of animal studies. Each essay is devoted to a particular 'term,'&nbsp;collectively covering a broad range of concerns with respect to the multifaceted interrelationships between humans and other animals...Recommended."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)</p><h2>Teaching Online</h2><p><em>Teaching Online: A Practical Guide</em> is an accessible, introductory, and comprehensive guide for anyone who teaches online.

We discuss some of the more versatile and popular data structures and explain how to implement and use them to solve a variety of useful problems. The book restricts itself to what can be covered in a one-semester course, without overwhelming the student with complexity and analysis. The approach is practical rather than theoretical.

Newkirk convincingly shows that effective argument is already a kind of narrative and is deeply "entwined with narrative."<br> <br> </em>--Gerald Graff, former MLA President and author of Clueless in Academe</p> <p>Narrative is regularly considered a type of writing-often an "easy" one, appropriate for early grades but giving way to argument and analysis in later grades. This groundbreaking book challenges all that. It invites readers to imagine narrative as something more-as the primary way we understand our world and ourselves. </p> <p><em> "To deny the centrality of narrative is to deny our own nature,"</em> Newkirk explains. <em>"We seek companionship of a narrator who maintains our attention, and perhaps affection. We are not made for objectivity and pure abstraction-for timelessness. We have 'literary minds" that respond to plot, character, and details in all kind of writing. As humans, we must tell stories."</em></p> <p>When we are engaged readers, we are following a story constructed by the author, regardless of the type of writing. To sustain a reading-in a novel, an opinion essay, or a research article- we need a "plot" that helps us comprehend specific information, or experience the significance of an argument. As Robert Frost reminds us, all good memorable writing is "dramatic." </p> <p><em>Minds Made for Stories </em> is a needed corrective to the narrow and compartmentalized approaches often imposed on schools-approaches which are at odds with the way writing really works outside school walls. </p></p><p><p>Thomas Newkirk is the author of numerous Heinemann titles, including Embarrassment, Minds Made for Stories, The Art of Slow Reading, The Performance of Self in Student Writing (winner of the NCTE's David H. Russell Award), and Misreading Masculinity.

Most expositors merely skim the surface for messages on tithing or sabbath-keeping. Yet Leviticus is one of the most important books of the Old Testament; it not only describes the complete religious system of ancient Israel, it also lays the theological foundation for the Christian gospel.<br><br>In Holiness to the Lord, Allen P. Ross enables preachers and teachers to mine the riches of Leviticus and deliver them to a contemporary audience. Following the same practical method he used in the acclaimed Creation and Blessing, Ross first carefully sites Leviticus within its context in the ancient world. Then he traces the development of God's plan of salvation-how Leviticus' laws, rituals, symbols, and events prepared for the complete revelation in Jesus Christ. Finally, unlike traditional commentaries, Ross offers helpful ideas for correlating Leviticus to New Testament teachings (particularly Romans, Hebrews, and Peter) and for applying the material in relevant expository form.<br><br>Holiness to the Lord is every expositor's indispensable guide for interpreting the Law for the church and for elucidating Leviticus in practical, biblical messages about worship, sanctification, and obedience.</p><p><b>Allen P. Ross</b> (Ph.D., University of Cambridge) is professor of Old Testament at Beeson Divinity School and has taught Hebrew grammar to seminary students for over thirty years. His publications include <i>Creation and Blessing: A Guide to the Study and Exposition of the Book of Genesis </i>and <i>Introducing Biblical Hebrew.</i>The task of interpreting and applying the Law in the present age calls for the expositor to follow an approach to the text that will work consistently in every chapter, whether it contains moral law, or laws of sacrifices, or civil laws of property and debts. This commentary presents such an approach and demonstrates how it would work out in each chapter of the book. . . . <p>What I have done is try to show the expositor how to bring all the material together in the development of the exposition, formulate the theological principles from the text, and correlate the derived meaning with the full revelation in the New Testament of each subject included in Leviticus. </p><p>There is enough theology in Leviticus by itself to form very useful, practical messages about worship, sanctification, and obedience. But with the New Testament correlations these ideas will be elevated to the person and work of Christ. The exposition is not complete without revealing how God used these laws, rituals, symbols, and events to prepare for the complete revelation in Jesus Christ.</p></p><h2>Culinary Tea: More Than 150 Recipes Steeped in Tradition from Around the World</h2><p>This cutting-edge tome on one of the world's oldest ingredients and most popular beverages will be an invaluable tool for both home and professional cooks.

A good scout knows the enemy and the enemy&#x2019;s terrain as well as his own, and is resourceful and incisive, cool-headed and courageous. A great scout is irreplaceable. And no greater scout than Frank Grouard has ever served in the US Army. During the Indian Wars in the American West, he was so valuable that General George Crook, considered the greatest of Indian fighters, said he would rather have lost a third of his command than Frank Grouard.<br><br>Indeed, few lives rival Grouard&#x2019;s for sheer excitement, danger, and achievement. He claimed to have been born on an island in the South Pacific, the son of a Mormon missionary and his Polynesian wife although others said he was part Indian. Among his many admirers was the great warrior Chief Sitting Bull, who saved young Grouard from death, gave him the Sioux name Standing Bear, held him semiprisoner, and raised him to be a Sioux warrior. He hunted with the Sioux, learned their language, and became skilled at reading the land for the presence of enemies. But when the chance came to escape, he took it, landing work as a scout for General Crook shortly thereafter.<br><br>Grouard once carried urgent dispatches over one hundred miles in less than four hours, an incredible feat on horseback, and was instrumental in setting up negotiations for the final surrender after Wounded Knee.

Craig Thompson's poignant graphic memoir plays out against the backdrop of a Midwestern winterscape: finely-hewn linework draws together a portrait of small town life, a rigorously fundamentalist Christian childhood, and a lonely, emotionally mixed-up adolescence.</p><p>Under an engulfing blanket of snow, Craig and Raina fall in love at winter church camp, revealing to one another their struggles with faith and their dreams of escape. Over time though, their personal demons resurface and their relationship falls apart. It's a universal story, and Thompson's vibrant brushstrokes and unique page designs make the familiar heartbreaking all over again.</p><p>This groundbreaking graphic novel, winner of two Eisner and three Harvey Awards, is an eloquent portrait of adolescent yearning; first love (and first heartache); faith in crisis; and the process of moving beyond all of that. Beautifully rendered in pen and ink, Thompson has created a love story that lasts.</p></p><p><b>Craig Thompson</b> is a cartoonist and the author of the award-winning books <i>Blankets</i>,<i> Carnet de Voyage</i><i>, Good-bye Chunky Rice</i><i>, </i>and <i>Habibi</i>. Thompson was born in Michigan in 1975, and grew up in a rural farming community in central Wisconsin. His graphic novel <i>Blankets</i> won numerous industry awards and has been published in nearly twenty languages around the world. Thompson lives in Portland, Oregon.Revisiting the themes of deep friendship and separation Thompson surveyed in Goodbye Chunky Rice, his acclaimed and touching debut, this sensitive memoir recreates the confusion, emotional pain and isolation of the author's rigidly fundamentalist Christian upbringing, along with the trepidation of growing into maturity. Skinny, naive and spiritually vulnerable, Thompson and his younger brother manage to survive their parents' overbearing discipline (the brothers are sometimes forced to sleep in "the cubby-hole," a forbidding and claustrophobic storage chamber) through flights of childhood fancy and a mutual love of drawing. But escapist reveries can't protect them from the cruel schoolmates who make their lives miserable. Thompson's grimly pious parents and religious community dismiss his budding talent for drawing; they view his creative efforts as sinful and relentlessly hector the boys about scripture. By high school, Thompson's a lost, socially battered and confused soul-until he meets Raina and her clique of amiable misfits at a religious camp. Beautiful, open, flexibly spiritual and even popular (something incomprehensible to young Thompson), Raina introduces him to her own less-than-perfect family; to a new teen community and to a broader sense of himself and his future. The two eventually fall in love and the experience ushers Thompson into the beginnings of an adult, independent life. Thompson manages to explore adolescent social yearnings, the power of young love and the complexities of sexual attraction with a rare combination of sincerity, pictorial lyricism and taste. His exceptional b&amp;w drawings balance representational precision with a bold and wonderfully expressive line for pages of ingenious, inventively composed and poignant imagery. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Spot &amp; Dot</h2><p><b>From beloved author-illustrator Henry Cole comes the stunning follow-up to <i>Spot, the Cat</i>.

Blackwood's literary renown began in 1908 with the publication of a highly successful collection of stories, <i>John Silence &#x2014; Physician Extraordinary</i>, featuring a "psychic doctor."<br>This volume contains all five of the John Silence stories from the 1908 edition plus one additional tale. Edited and with an informative introduction by S. T. Joshi, noted occult fiction authority, the stories include "A Psychical Invasion," in which Silence is summoned to a house apparently haunted by former tenants. In "Ancient Sorceries," he encounters a man who tells of strange experiences in a small French town; and in "Secret Worship," an ill-starred character is rescued from spiritual and perhaps physical death. "The Nemesis of Fire," "The Camp of the God," and "A Victim of Higher Space" conclude this collection of spellbinding tales, which will delight any devotee of "weird" literature.</p><p>Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951) maintained a lifelong fascination with the occult and spiritualism. In addition to writing 10 books of short stories and 14 novels, he served as a British secret agent during World War I and received a knighthood in 1949.</p><h2>Thermopylae: The Battle That Changed the World</h2><p>In 480 B.C., the mighty Persian king Xerxes led a massive force to the narrow mountain pass called Thermopylae, anticipating no significant resistance in his bid to conquer Greece. But the Greeks, led by Leonidas and a small army of Spartan warriors, took the battle to the Persians and nearly halted their advance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul Cartledge's riveting, authoritative account of King Leonidas and the legendary 300 illuminates this valiant endeavor that changed the way future generations would think about combat, courage, and death.</p><p><b>Paul Cartledge</b>, professor of Greek history at the University of Cambridge, is the author of <i>Alexander the Great, The Spartans, </i>and <i>The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization.</i>Chapter One<br><br>THE ANCIENT WORLD IN 500 bce: FROM INDIA TO THE AEGEAN<br><br>In Lacedaimon are to be found those who are the most enslaved [douloi] and those who are the most free.<br><br>Critias of Athens, Spartan Society<br><br>Herodotus begins by placing his chosen subject of the Graeco-Persian Wars in the broadest framework of East versus West historical and (what we should call) myth-historical conflict. A major 'moment' in that chronic Greek-barbarian, West-East contest was the Trojan War sung by Homer in the Iliad. Like its companion epic the Odyssey, the Iliad was the culmination of a long bardic tradition of oral poetic composition and recitation stretching back to the Late Bronze Age or Mycenaean era. But if there was one Homer, that genius of a monumental poet who created the unified stories of Achilles and Odysseus, he would have lived somewhere in east Greece; that is, along the west Anatolian littoral or on one of its offshore Greek islands such as Chios, at around 700 bce.<br><br>This was also, and not coincidentally, when Ilium or New Troy was founded on what was taken to be the site of Homer's Troy by Greeks coming out from central mainland Greece to settle permanently in north-west Asia Minor. Ilium was just one of a whole host of such new Greek foundations established during the age of Greek 'colonization' which occupied the two centuries from about 700-500.* This great movement of people was prompted by a variety of motives and factors including land hunger, political faction-fighting and sheer adventurism. By the end of it, Greeks were to be found perched (as Plato later put it) like frogs or ants around a pond - or rather two ponds, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.<br><br>The resulting Greek world in the year 500 was not a political unit but rather a series of individual, independent, often mutually hostile political communities that mostly called themselves poleis, or cities. We would call them republics, though there were a number of monarchies among them too - and a unique 'dyarchy', or double kingship, Sparta. There were well over one thousand such independent units all told, scattered around much of the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts - from, as the Greeks themselves said, the Pillars of Heracles (Straits of Gibraltar) to Phasis (in modern Georgia at the far eastern end of the Black Sea).<br><br>Most lived in Europe, extending from Byzantium (modern Istanbul) in the east to the southern coast of Spain in the far west, and taking in most of coastal Sicily and southern Italy and part of the French Riviera. There were some Greeks settled in Africa too, along the Mediterranean coasts of today's Libya and Egypt, most notably at Cyrene and at Naucratis in the Nile delta. But there were many more Greeks living in Asia than in Africa, and it was in Asia that settlement out of the Greek mainland had first begun, well before the 'colonization' movement proper. Miletus, for example, in Ionia was founded already in the eleventh century bce, at the beginning of an era known to scholars as the Greek Dark Age (c. 1100-800). It was the Greeks of Asia and the major offshore islands (Lesbos, Chios and Samos) who first felt the lash of the Persian whip.<br><br>By 500 the Persian Empire, founded just half a century earlier, was established as the fastest-growing empire in the entire history of the ancient East. It stretched from the Indian subcontinent to the eastern shore of the Aegean, and it encompassed the ancient territories of Egypt and Babylonia besides its Iranian heartland. The two cultures, the Greek and the Persian, overlapped, intermingled or clashed first at the western, Mediterranean margins of the Persian Empire. Some Greek cities located at the western fringe of Asia had even been forcibly incorporated into the Empire in the 540s. This situation provoked mixed reactions among the conquered Greeks themselves and among their cultural and ethnic kinspeople yet further to the west. In 499 a number of these eastern Greeks raised the flag of revolt, aided and abetted by the newly democratic city of Athens. The seeds of the Graeco-Persian Wars of 490 and 480-479 had been sown. The encounter at Thermopylae was only a matter of time.<br><br>The Graeco-Persian conflict must first be situated within its broadest geopolitical limits. The account that follows will move from East to West and look at the world through mainly Persian eyes. It begins in the Far East, with what the Greeks rather hopefully called 'India', though they meant only what is now Pakistan and Kashmir and but a relatively tiny part of the modern state of India.* The Persians were the first power with any claim whatsoever to a 'European' identity - via their membership of the 'Indo-European' language family - to establish a physical and political toehold on the subcontinent, during the reign of Darius I (about 522-486).<br><br>This tentative occupation involved passage over the Hindu Kush mountain range, what the Greeks called the Paropamisus, and passage, most easily, through the Khyber Pass. Hardly surprisingly, though, the Persians' reach soon exceeded their grasp. The conquest of their version of 'India' proved just a brief moment within the two-hundred- year span of the Achaemenid imperial monarchy as a whole. From the Indians the Persian Empire demanded tribute, as it did from all its subjects. Herodotus tells us that India's contribution amounted to the fantastic, indeed fabulous, sum of 360 talents of gold-dust, in an era when gold was reckoned fourteen times more valuable, weight for weight, than silver.<br><br>But if the Persian Empire's Far East could be more or less willingly relinquished after Darius without threatening its integrity, that was not at all the case with the Empire's north-east frontier: the steppelands of Sogdiana, and Bactria, today's central Asia and northern Afghanistan. It was here that the Empire's great founder, Cyrus II, had met a gory end, fighting the Massagetae tribespeople of central Asia led by their fierce queen Tomyris (as the Greeks transcribed her name). And Darius's propagandistic relief sculpture at Bisitun in Media (not far from Ecbatana, modern Hamadan in northern Iran) was suitably rounded off by an image of Skunkha (who, by any other name, would presumably have smelled sweeter): he was King of the Skudra (Scythians) living east of the Caspian Sea.<br><br>Moving westwards through the Empire we come next to its Iranian heartland. In the deep south of Iran the region known as Fars preserves the speaking trace of its original Persian occupants. The Greeks gave two names to the major capital located down here. The earlier was 'Persai' - literally 'the Persians'. Later, when Iran had become part of the post-Alexander hellenized Middle East, it became Persepolis, 'City of the Persians'. This is the name that has stuck, though in its suggestion that Persepolis was a polis (citizen-state) in anything like the same sense as Athens, Thebes or Sparta it can be grossly misleading.<br><br>In Achaemenid times Persai/Persepolis functioned as, among other things, the Empire's chief ceremonial capital. It was the site of the great New Year festival and the place where tokens of imperial tribute were ceremonially borne in procession by representatives of the many subject peoples, as lavishly depicted on the walls of the Apadana, or great regal Audience Hall. It was near here too, at Naqsh- i-Rustam, that the Persians' kings were buried - or at least commemorated - in handsome rock-cut tombs. Almost as important to the Persians themselves was another capital further to the north and west in Iran - Susa in Elam, which served mainly as the principal administrative centre of government. Also important as a capital city was Ecbatana in Media. The Persian kings seem to have evolved a regular schedule of movement from one palatial capital to another depending on the time of year; upland Ecbatana, for example, was the royal residence in high summer. Apart from its sheer practicality and symbolic value, this royal nomadism may ultimately reflect the Persians' origins as transhumant pastoralists.<br><br>Next towards the West is Mesopotamia, the 'Between-the-Rivers Land' of modern Iraq, between the Tigris and the Euphrates. In 539 Cyrus secured the key citadel of Babylon on the Euphrates. This fabled city of great antiquity and of the wondrous 'hanging gardens' of Nebuchadnezzar was where another great conqueror, Alexander the Great, was to die two centuries later, and where, arguably, he intended to place the centre of his own new empire. The wealth of Babylonia was legendary, in both mineral resources and in arable crops.*<br><br>West again of Mesopotamia the Persians entered Anatolia, modern Turkey. It is very striking indeed that Cyrus should have thought to extend his empire as far as the Aegean, and therefore to embrace all Anatolia including certain Greek cities, in the 540s, before making sure of Babylonia next door. Immediately before Cyrus's reign the great power of Anatolia was the kingdom of Lydia, the inland region just to the east of Greek Ionia with its capital at heavily fortified - and heavily hellenized - Sardis. Ruled, in the mid-sixth century, by the proverbially wealthy Croesus, it was this kingdom that provided the political and cultural link between Anatolia and the Greeks of the mainland and Aegean islands.<br><br>Herodotus tells his story of Croesus's dealings with various Greeks with his usual lively aplomb. To start on the negative side of the ledger, Croesus was the first historical oriental king permanently to subjugate Greeks. At first he confined his attention to those of the Asiatic mainland (of Aeolis, Ionia and Caria, going from north to south), but he is said to have seriously contemplated adding to his domain the main adjacent Aegean islands, Lesbos, Chios and Samos, until it was pointedly borne in upon him that he was a land-based power and lacking any sort of suitable navy. On the other, positive side, the imperial rule of Croesus over the Greeks of Asia does not appear to have been massively burdensome. Herodotus tells a jolly moral tale of the reforming lawmaker Solon (appointed troubleshooter at Athens in 594) taking time out from his domestic business to visit Croesus in Sardis and deliver to him a homily on the true nature of happiness for a human being. The implication is that Croesus, though an absolute ruler, was no terrifyingly deadly oriental despot.<br><br>Herodotus's tale of their meeting must on chronological grounds be sheer fiction (since Solon was almost certainly dead well before Croesus came to the throne of Lydia about 560), but it is not fiction that Croesus engaged in sympathetic dealings with Greeks. Herodotus refers to his gifts to the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, and the extraordinarily well made group of chryselephantine statues (gold and ivory on a wooden core) discovered here, probably representing Leto and her two children Apollo and Artemis and done in an eastern Greek style, may well be a token or reflection of that generosity. Proof of this is still visible at Ephesus on the Ionian coast of Anatolia: here Croesus paid for elaborately beautiful architectural enhancements to the temple of Ephesian Artemis - St Paul's 'Diana of the Ephesians' - which in a later incarnation was ranked one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world.<br><br>What of the Persians' interest in the Levant and in Africa, especially Egypt? Cyrus II's designated successor was his eldest son Cambyses. Like father, grossly unlike son. Whereas Cyrus was f�ted even by his conquered subjects (the restored Jews went so far as to call him 'Messiah'), Cambyses suffered from a hostile press, both from his own Persian side and from the side of the Greeks. However, precisely, Cambyses died - it may have been by suicide or by murder - it was in unfortunate circumstances. His brief and relatively inglorious reign was followed by an interregnum, if not some sort of usurpation. But he had at least achieved one major feat: the conquest of Egypt. Greek sources tended to imagine that Cambyses was unhinged by his success, and that in his delirium he killed Apis, the Egyptians' sacred bull, at the old capital of Memphis. The sober records of the Apis priests themselves survive - and tell a different story. Cyrus's was a hard act for Cambyses to follow - as Darius's was to be for his son and successor Xerxes. But Cambyses should be given the credit for the incorporation of Egypt into the Empire, along with the Phoenicians of the Levant and Cyprus, who thereafter provided the bulk of the Empire's Mediterranean navy.<br><br>Our survey of the Persian Empire's development up to the year 500 concludes with Darius's expedition of 513 to 'the lands beyond the sea'; that is, to European Thrace beyond the Black Sea across the Bosporus strait dividing Asia from Europe. Today there is a permanent Bosporus bridge. Darius had to commission a temporary one, a pontoon bridge of many boats - likewise, the bridge whereby he crossed the Ister (Danube) later on in the same campaign. The Greeks liked to make out that this 'Scythian' campaign was a fiasco, but it presumably achieved what it set out to do. A new Persian province of European Thrace was thereafter firmly in place to guard Darius's north-west frontier, and a stepping-stone had been laid down for further European expansion in due course if and when that was felt desirable or necessary. By 500 Macedonia, on Thrace's western border, was also a Persian vassal state, and the Persians' tax-demanding writ extended to the borders of Greek Thessaly.<br><br>What of the other Greeks of the mainland? It was to them (if Herodotus is to be believed) that Croesus of Lydia's thoughts had turned in the 540s when he learned of the threatening rise of Cyrus to his east. Nor was it just these Greeks' military force that he hoped to exploit, but also the numinous power of their oracular gods. Croesus supposedly tested the alleged infallibility of a number of Greek oracular shrines. In the event, only Apollo's oracle at Delphi in central Greece, the 'navel of the universe', was able to solve his riddle. Croesus then formally consulted the Pythia, Apollo's prophetic priestess who with the aid of male priests issued measurably correct but sometimes fatally ambiguous pronouncements, on how he should react to Cyrus. The Delphic response solemnly informed him that if he crossed the River Halys, the eastern frontier of his kingdom, he would destroy a great empire. He did, and he did, but the empire he destroyed was, alas, his own, not Cyrus's. As things turned out, he was unable to derive any support at all from the mainland Greek city to which he had allied himself on the grounds that it was the most powerful military state in Greece. That state was Sparta.<br><br>Sparta in about 550, as Herodotus tells the tale, had recently undergone some sort of serious upset, but now it was flourishing both in its domestic political stability, guaranteed by the wise laws of Lycurgus, and in all its external wars. Herodotus was indeed persuaded that the Peloponnese as a whole was already 'subjugated' by Sparta. But there was one notable exception. The city of Argos never accepted Sparta's hegemony of the Peloponnese, let alone of any wider tract of Hellas.</p><h2>9th Judgement</h2><p>A psychopathic killer targets San Francisco&#39;s most innocent and vulnerable.

In<br>the latter he saw an aged man who had lived for six long<br>decades of turf-digging and loom-mending, of flint-slitting<br>and rock-breaking and pond-dredging and rabbit-trapping and<br>slate-fixing, all with nothing to show for it but twisted fingers<br>and a locked left knee, a squint and a crooked spine. He saw<br>that the old man&#x2019;s dark eyes seemed to hold the seeds of fire too,<br>and that his chin was pointed and one temple scarred with a<br>white mess of flesh healed into a tight pattern like the fossilised<br>form of flowering lichen across a wet valley rock. The mashed<br>markings of a true coin smelter.<br>The Alchemist extended an arm. He held out a palm,<br>requested alms.<br>David Hartley produced a pouch and poured half of it into<br>the hand of The Alchemist who took the shears and clipped<br>each coin in turn until he had a small pile of slivers.<br>With neat movements he circled the fire and roddled the<br>coals and pumped the bellows.<br>The remaining coins he deftly stacked in a tower on the floor.<br>With his poker he tapped the pot and the four men leaned<br>in to see that the guinea shards were changing shape. Softening<br>and collapsing. They were gaining a liquid sheen.<br>The Alchemist signalled for the men to step back as he<br>unwrapped another cloth and set down beside him a selection<br>of moulds and dies of different sizes. He carefully arranged<br>5 5<br> them. He touched them once. He touched them twice, then<br>with tongs he lifted the pot from the fire and poured its contents<br>into four of the moulds. The pot he set aside.<br>Still squatting and stock still, The Alchemist muttered words<br>to himself. The Hartleys could not determine what he was saying.<br>His whispered words ran into one another. Strange incantations.<br>He uttered a song without a melody. An inaudible spell for the<br>casting of the metal. A twisting of the tongue.<br>Then in a sudden burst of movement The Alchemist snatched<br>up a spelter stamp in one hand and hammer in the other. The<br>stamp he pressed down onto the first mould and he twirled<br>the hammer once and then twice over the back of his hand<br>in a conjurer&#x2019;s display of showmanship before swinging it and<br>bringing it down hard on the head of the stamp. He struck again<br>and again, the shrill judder of metal on metal reverberating.<br>The stamp he cast aside before seizing the next one &#x2013; this<br>slightly larger &#x2013; and swinging and striking in quick succession.<br>Four times he did this, one after another; the stone space<br>echoing with the hammer&#x2019;s call.<br>Then he laid his tools aside. There were beads of sweat on his<br>brow now. They looked black. As black as the dew that settles<br>on the coomb of a coalman&#x2019;s shovelled remnants.<br>The Alchemist turned the moulds upside down and tapped<br>the bottom of each so that their contents fell into a bowl of<br>water that steamed with each newly-forged coin. Then he spoke.<br>He said: the white hot hiss is a vicious liquid kiss from the lady<br>of the fire who is softer than silver and swifter than light.<br>What&#x2019;s that? said Isaac Hartley. What&#x2019;s he saying?<br>The mottled dirty water he threw onto the hot coals and<br>these too hissed and steamed and spat tiny gobbets of dead and<br>dying embers in a cloud of smothering muffled smoke that had<br>all the men but The Alchemist, who seemed impervious to it,<br>hacking and rubbing at their eyes.<br>He rattled the bowl and swirled its contents then flicked the<br>newly-forged and stamped coins into his hand. From a pocket<br>5 6<br> he produced a rag and a small snuff box of dark daubing into<br>which he dipped a blackened digit and dabbed some of its<br>contents onto each coin. With an economical flourish he buffed<br>each disc.<br>He slowly stood and handed a coin in turn to young William<br>Hartley and Isaac Hartley and the old man William Hartley<br>the elder. At David Hartley he paused and held the coin aloft<br>between thumb and forefinger and in the half-light it seemed to<br>turn and spin of its own accord and he said come, come press a<br>coin into my palm and I&#x2019;ll return you two like a curse reversed<br>on a gypsy&#x2019;s tongue.<br>David Hartley took the coin.<br>He touched it. He studied it. It still held within it the warmth<br>of the fire. He examined it further.<br>He said: this work is good.<br>The Alchemist said nothing.<br>Here, he&#x2019;s milled the rim, said William Hartley, and David<br>Hartley studied the tiny writing that ran around the side of the<br>coin.<br>Do you know what these words say? asked The Alchemist.<br>No, I do not said, David Hartley. They are not in any language<br>that any right-minded man round these parts would know even<br>if they were book learners.<br>That&#x2019;s because these words is Latin, said The Alchemist.<br>Decus Et Tutamen . They say: An Ornament and a Safeguard.<br>A hundred years or more this coin has carried these words and<br>I&#x2019;d wager it&#x2019;ll carry them for a hundred more.<br>What&#x2019;s all this Latin for?<br>Latin is the language that the crown favours, said William<br>Hartley Sr. It&#x2019;s what they speak across foreign waters and it<br>makes the king think he&#x2019;s better than common folk.<br>I&#x2019;m not no fucking common folk, said David Hartley. I&#x2019;m a<br>king too; a king that&#x2019;s more respected amongst his own folk<br>than these betterny-bodies who think their shit smells as sweet<br>as pollen. And I&#x2019;m a king that doesn&#x2019;t need no fucking foreign<br> tongue from across no foreign waters to make him feel big about<br>himself, nor a crown upon his napper. All I wear is the sky above<br>me, and the only throne this man needs is that which sits above<br>the shitting pit.</p><h2>World War II US Fast Carrier Task Force Tactics 1943&#x2013;45 (Elite)</h2><p><p><b>A succinct but detailed illustrated explanation of the techniques by which the ships and aircraft of the US Fast Carrier Task Forces achieved their victories over the Imperial Japanese Navy. </b></p><p>Drawing on difficult-to-access wartime documents and other contemporary sources, this is the first compact, illustrated study of the tactics and techniques of the US fast carriers of Task Forces 50, 58 and 38 during the naval war against Japan in 1943--45. </p><p>This title concentrates on exactly how these highly successful forces actually operated: their composition in ships, aircraft, and men; the essential technology at their disposal; the evolving doctrine for their employment; the opposition and dangers they faced; and how they overcame them at the tactical level.

In addition to essential instruction on field dressing and transport, the author goes on to cover salting and tanning hides, aging venison, leathercrafting, soapmaking, trophy mounting, and creating home furnishings and decorations. Also included is a selection of mouthwatering venison recipes, making this an indispensable resource for any hunter looking to extend the hunting experience beyond the moment of the kill.</p></li></p><p>Dennis Walrod has written for a number of outdoor magazines, including Field and Stream, Outdoor Life, and Gray&#39;s Sporting Journal. He lives in western New York State. To find out more about Dennis Walrod and his books, check out his Website at: www.denniswalrod.com.Experienced deer hunter Walrod delivers a thoughtful, well-written and clearly illustrated look at the full range of do-it-yourself ways that a hunter can utilize a deer after it has been killed. The scope of Walrod's topics, from field dressing and venison preparation to handicrafts and taxidermy, makes this a must-have for hunters. It helps that Walrod's attention to detail is motivated by the philosophic view that if hunters "are able to realize that within us is a responsibility to use a deer to the fullest advantage and value, we will have enhanced not only the worth of a deer, but our own worth as well." This means that along with such helpful tips as proving that "a five-inch blade knife of good cutting steel" is the minimum required for venison butchering and showing the best technique for removing a deer's "guts" as a single package, he also offers tips on how to donate deer to one of several charitable programs, such as Farmers and Hunters Feeding the Hungry. A chapter on "Venison and How to Butcher It" breaks down this intricate process into simple steps, using clear and often entertaining descriptions to show how, with a little practice, "you should be able to completely butcher, cut, and wrap a skinned deer within two or three hours." He also offers a number of helpful photos and excellent tips and recipes for cooking venison. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tax policies and their enforcement have become a disaster, and thanks to discreet lobbying by a segment of the top 1 percent, Washington is reluctant or unable to fix them. The corporate income tax, the estate tax, and the gift tax have been largely ignored by the media. But the cumulative results are remarkable: today someone who earns a yearly salary of $60,000 pays a larger percentage of his income in taxes than the four hundred richest Americans.</p><p>Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter David Cay Johnston exposes exactly how the middle class is being squeezed to create a widening wealth gap that threatens the stability of the country. By relating the compelling tales of real people across all areas of society, he reveals the truth behind:</p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<p>"Middle class" tax cuts and exactly whom they benefit.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<p>How workers are being cheated out of their retirement plans while disgraced CEOs walk away with millions.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<p>How some corporations avoid paying any federal income tax.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<p>How a law meant to prevent cheating by the top 2 percent of Americans no longer affects most of them, but has morphed into a stealth tax on single mothers making just $28,000.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<p>Why the working poor are seven times more likely to be audited by the IRS than everyone else.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<p>How the IRS became so weak that even when it was handed complete banking records detailing massive cheating by 1,600 people, it prosecuted only 4 percent of them.</p><br><p>Johnston has been breaking pieces of this story on the front page of <b>The New York Times</b> for seven years. With <b>Perfectly Legal</b>, he puts the whole shocking narrative together in a way that will stir up media attention and make readers angry about the state of our country.</p></p><p>Most Americans would agree that they are duty bound as beneficiaries of our democracy to pay taxes, and the majority of us do pay&#x2014;-exorbitantly. But what about those who do not pay their fair share? David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the <i>New York Times</i>, here reveals how fairness and equity have eroded from the American tax system. Johnston describes in shocking detail the loopholes our government provides the "super rich"--from private individuals to profitable corporations&#x2014;-to hide their wealth, to defer or evade tax payments, and to pass the bill to law-abiding middle-class Americans. The loss in revenue "imposes a severe cost on honest taxpayers" through reduced services, increased federal debt, and a weight on the middle class that threatens to impede its ability to achieve upward social mobility. <p></p>Admitting the extreme complexity of our economy and by extension our tax code, Johnston points out that the very wealthy do, of course, pay taxes. However, because of shelters that allow them to understate most of their income, they pay little more on average than most Americans on the dollar. This is regressive, and unquestionably favors the superrich. Johnston includes examples of outrageous corporate malfeasance (such as companies that establish off-shore tax addresses) and exposes the tax benefits of the particularly loathsome practice made famous by Jack Welch, in which thousands of wage earners are laid off while a handful of executives are granted hundreds of millions of dollars through deferred compensation, company stock options, and lucrative retirement packages, all at stock holders' xpense. In addition to these offenses, he describes the tax evasion methods of those who simply defy the law and are emboldened by a beleaguered IRS that is too underfunded to serve as an effective deterrent to tax cheats. Johnston calls for a complete overhaul of the system. But because those who most benefit from these laws comprise the "donor class" that supports the government power structure, our prospects for reform remain very bleak. --<i>Silvana Tropea</i><b>David Cay Johnston</b>&nbsp;is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning reporter who has been called the &#x201c;de facto chief tax enforcement officer of the United States.&#x201d; His most recent books,&nbsp;<i>Perfectly Legal&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Free Lunch</i>,&nbsp;were&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestsellers.

But the stately calm of country life is destroyed when their neighbor, the Marquess of Montagu, bursts through the French doors from the garden and falls down dead in front of the shocked gathering. But who has a motive for murdering the young aristocrat? The lovely cousin who was threatened by his engagement, the Oxford friend he falsely accused of cheating, the scheming vicar's daughter he shamelessly seduced or the relative no one knew existed who appears to claim the Montagu title?

One family's hidden past and a forbidden passion are the clues to a puzzle only Lady Emily can solve.</p></p><p>The daughter of two philosophy professors, I grew up surrounded by books. I was convinced from an early age that I was born in the wrong century and spent much of my childhood under the dining room table pretending it was a covered wagon. Even there, I was never without a book in hand and loved reading and history more than anything. I studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. Writing is a natural offshoot of reading, and my first novel,&nbsp;<i>And Only to Deceive</i>, was published in 2005. I'm the author of the long-running Lady Emily Series as well as the novel&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</i>. One of the best parts of being an author is seeing your books translated, and I'm currently in love with the Japanese editions of the Emily books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I played nomad for a long time, living in Indiana, Amsterdam, London, Wyoming, Vermont, Connecticut, and Tennessee before settling down. My husband, the brilliant British novelist&nbsp;Andrew Grant&nbsp;(I may be biased but that doesn't mean I'm wrong) and I now divide our time between Chicago and Wyoming. He makes sure I get my English characters right, and I make sure his American ones sound American.1 <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;This, Emily, goes beyond bad manners.&#x201d; Lady Catherine Bromley squared her shoulders, shook her head without displacing a single silver hair, and glowered at me, her only daughter. &#x201c;One cannot have gentlemen falling down dead in the library, especially on an eighteenth-century Axminster carpet! It is entirely ruined; there is no possibility that bloodstain will come out. Such a thing would never be tolerated at Darnley House. What would your father say? I thank heaven that estate business took him home before he could see this.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The dead are notoriously unreliable when it comes to standards of behavior,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Particularly murder victims. They have no sense of decorum at all.&#x201d; <br>Another evening <i>en famille</i> at Anglemore Park. <br>Anglemore, prettily situated in Derbyshire in the midst of the Peak District, had been the seat of the Hargreaves family since Henry V&#x2019;s victory at Agincourt, after which the land had been given by the grateful king to one of my husband&#x2019;s ancestors for bravery in battle. During the reign of Henry VIII, the grounds, through a royal grant, expanded to include a nearby abbey, defunct after the reformation and all but destroyed by Cromwell&#x2019;s men. Its ruins, perched near a large lake, were some of the most picturesque in all of England, as if the structure had crumbled with deliberately artistic intent. The main house, originally built in the fifteenth century, had been added to and altered over the years, leaving it now with an Elizabethan exterior replete with rows of the most charming bay windows giving nearly every room a perfect nook for reading and none of the museum-like feel of so many great estates. <br>Anglemore was a house that was loved, a house that had sheltered the same family for more than four centuries. Generations of Hargreaves children (all born on the estate&#x2014;no other location would be tolerated, even today) had carved their initials in the wooden bannister on the back stairs leading to the nursery. The family was rooted here, passionate about the land, deeply connected to their tenants, and confident beyond doubt that there was no better place to serve as one&#x2019;s anchor. Most of the family married in the chapel, and all of them were buried on the grounds in a towering mausoleum built in the late seventeenth century by a Hargreaves gentleman who, horrified by the Great Plague, determined he must make every effort to see his mortal remains well placed. In a letter written during the height of the epidemic, his wife, angry with him for spending what she viewed as too much time hunting, had threatened him with plague pits. <br>Today, despite tens of thousands of acres of land, a sizable house, and enough outbuildings to hold several villages, the estate felt nothing but crowded. Crowded by my visiting mother, the Countess Catherine Bromley, whose inflexible views on child rearing, wholly at odds with my own, had not contributed to a state one could describe as domestic bliss. She had come to Anglemore months ago, following the birth of our twins, but had not stayed long, informing us she would return once the London Season had finished and after she had hosted at least two shooting parties. Only then, she said, would she have the presence of mind and clarity of concentration to ensure the children were being looked after properly. Now we were bearing the full brunt of this mission. Her visit had weeks ago taken on the feeling of an endless tour through one of Dante&#x2019;s less pleasant circles of hell. <br>The evening had started badly, with her complaining bitterly about each course at dinner. She had found fault with the game dish in particular, objecting to pheasant stuffed with foie gras for reasons wholly indecipherable to me. Afterward, we had retired to the library, where our second houseguest, Simon Lancaster, Earl Flyte, offered his apologies and went to bed after having been interrogated by her on the subject of politics. One could hardly blame the poor man. Unhappy with his views, she had hounded him, all but following him to his room when he at last excused himself. My husband, Colin Hargreaves, buried himself in James&#x2019;s <i>The Portrait of a Lady,</i> ignoring with deft skill my mother&#x2019;s litany of questions about his views on how our boys ought to be raised. She had, it seemed, either grown fatigued of political discussion or realized she would be incapable of besting him on the subject. Eventually forced to accept that she was quite unable to penetrate his wall, she turned her attention to reprimanding a housemaid for not having tended adequately to the fire&#x2014;a fire I was not convinced we needed on such a fine night. <br>&#x201c;There are infants in the house,&#x201d; my mother said. &#x201c;I shall not allow Henry or Richard to catch a chill.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Or Tom, Mother,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You mustn&#x2019;t forget Tom.&#x201d; It was the presence of this third child, our ward, that caused my mother considerable agitation. &#x201c;They are all two floors and one wing removed from us, not to mention in the care of an exceptionally capable nanny and her staff. I shouldn&#x2019;t worry if I were you. Furthermore, it is an unusually warm evening. They are more likely to be overheated than cold.&#x201d; To demonstrate the point, I crossed the room and flung open all six sets of French doors overlooking the neatly manicured terrace, its beds full of bright dahlias, chrysanthemums, and late asters. Autumn was at its best, a perfect September night. The sun had disappeared while we were in the dining room, leaving only a few streaks of gold in the inky sky. I pulled something to read down from the shelf without glancing at the title and installed myself in an overstuffed chair as far from the fireplace as possible. Nothing, I vowed silently, would distract me from this book. <br>Should it have become necessary, honoring this promise would have proved exceedingly difficult. The volume I had so carelessly chosen, a treatise on advanced mathematical theorems, had no hope of holding my attention for long, but it did not need to. No sooner had I soldiered through the introductory pages than the previously mentioned gentleman, tall and broad in his evening kit, staggered through one of the French doors. He braced himself on the frame, looked at Colin, took one step in his direction, and collapsed facedown on the floor. <br>My mother shrieked in a fashion so decidedly unladylike she would have been horrified to hear it. She swayed, unsteady on her feet, and appeared on the verge of fainting. I dashed to her side, took her firmly by the shoulders, and turned her to face me. <br>&#x201c;Now is not the time, Mother,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Do try to remember there are no smelling salts allowed in this house. Perish any thought you had of fainting.&#x201d; <br>The words&#x2014;and, no doubt, my tone&#x2014;shocked her into compliance, just as I had hoped. The color did not return to her visage, but she steeled herself, pulled her back straight, and looked away from the scene developing before us. There was no time to comfort her. We needed to focus on the injured man. <br>My husband, a trusted agent of the Crown and, hence, no stranger to trauma, disruption, and brutality, motioned for me to stay back while he knelt beside the prostrate stranger. <br>&#x201c;His heart is not beating,&#x201d; Colin said, &#x201c;and he is not breathing.&#x201d; His lips firm in a tight line, he closed the man&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I am afraid there is nothing to be done.&#x201d; I moved closer, standing behind him, watching as he carefully inspected the corpse for injuries. <br>&#x201c;He is dead?&#x201d; My mother&#x2019;s voice was rising to a screech. She pressed with trembling hands a linen handkerchief to her face. &#x201c;This is too dreadful. I cannot bear it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do try to be calm, Lady Bromley,&#x201d; Colin said. &#x201c;Hysteria will help no one.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a fierce scratch on his left hand,&#x201d; I said, ignoring my mother, who had started to sway again. This time I was willing to let her faint, although I doubted she would bother when the odds of anyone catching her were so low. <br>&#x201c;He may have been fighting.&#x201d; Colin lifted the man&#x2019;s head to reveal a deep gash splitting the skull, blood congealing on the carpet beneath it. <br>&#x201c;Have you any idea who he is?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;He is wholly unfamiliar to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;None,&#x201d; Colin said. <br>This admission revived my mother. She took a step towards us, made a point of forcing herself to look at the unfortunate corpse, and spoke, her voice loaded with a mixture of disgust and condescension. &#x201c;That is Archibald Scolfield, the new Marquess of Montagu. He arrived from London yesterday. You ought to have known that, Emily, given that he&#x2019;s to be your nearest&#x2014;and titled&#x2014;neighbor. His cousin Matilda was hosting a party for him this evening. A party I believe you didn&#x2019;t bother to attend.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I sent her our regrets,&#x201d; I said, noticing that my mother&#x2019;s face had gone an alarming shade of gray as she approached the body. She, unlike me, was not used to violent death. I had initially become close to Colin while trying to solve the murder of my first husband, Philip, Viscount Ashton. While embroiled in the case, I discovered I possessed a certain aptitude for the work, and had subsequently contributed to the arrests of six more violent criminals, earning for myself a reputation as a solid investigator. Colin and I, now married, made an excellent team, as even the queen herself had been forced to admit on more than one occasion. <br>I stepped to the marble fireplace, over which hung a fragment of a Roman fresco depicting a joyful scene of marriage, and rang the bell next to it. &#x201c;We ought to summon the authorities.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The authorities?&#x201d; The color rushed back into my mother&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be absurd. Lord Montagu fell and hit his head, probably on a rock. Why on earth would you involve the police or sheriff or whatever unseemly sort of <i>authority</i> is to be found? Send for your personal physician and insist he sign a death certificate at once and be done with the dreadful business. Gentlemen ought not to be so cavalier about wandering around the countryside after dark.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing about this situation suggests an accident,&#x201d; Colin said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid we&#x2019;ve no choice but to summon the police, Lady Bromley.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do you want a scandal?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;On your own estate?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Surely, Mother, you are not questioning my husband&#x2019;s judgment?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I can assure you he&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It is quite all right, Emily,&#x201d; Colin said. &#x201c;Your mother has nothing but the best of intentions. However, Lady Bromley, given my position, it is essential I report this incident with no delay. To do otherwise would be less than honorable. Perhaps you would like to retire upstairs for a bit? It will give you a chance to recover from the shock of what has transpired. I shall send for you when the police are ready to speak to you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Speak to me?&#x201d; My mother&#x2019;s eyes bugged. &#x201c;Speak to me? As if I would be involved in such a thing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You saw Lord Montagu take his last breaths and collapse,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The police will need to hear your description of what happened.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I do not know why you are still standing here, Emily,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If you believe there is some sort of criminal on the loose in the neighborhood who is going about murdering people, you ought to be ensuring the safety of your boys rather than embroiling yourself in an unsavory debacle utterly inappropriate for a lady. Children are always a mother&#x2019;s primary duty.&#x201d; <br>I took a deep breath and paused before replying. First and foremost, I knew I need not worry about the boys because they were in the hands of a most trustworthy nanny. Second, the idea that my mother, who had limited her involvement with her children up to the age of twelve to formal visits made once daily for not more than a quarter of an hour, would condemn me for relying on said nanny struck me as not a little hypocritical. I had always forgiven her neglect because she and my father had lost so many of their offspring to illness. I, the youngest, was the only one of seven to survive to adulthood. My mother had recovered from the death from influenza of my twin brothers, the only of my siblings I had ever known, by distancing herself even further from me until it was time to mold me into a sparkling debutante. &#x201c;Perhaps you could take care of that for me. Nanny should be put on alert.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I shall see to it at once,&#x201d; my mother said. &#x201c;Heaven knows someone in this household ought to be concerned about what matters, rather than getting distracted by the details of some ridiculous <i>alleged</i> crime.&#x201d; She marched out, slamming the door behind her. <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t think of less propitious circumstances in which to find ourselves. She could impede an investigation before having her first cup of tea in the morning.&#x201d; I sighed. &#x201c;One of us should go to Montagu and inform Matilda of what has happened.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Would you be so kind as to handle that?&#x201d; Colin asked. &#x201c;You are better acquainted with her than I. I shall have Flyte come down and inquire whether he heard anything and then deal with the police when they arrive.&#x201d; <br>I nodded. &#x201c;Of course. The police will doubtless respond better to you than to me. As for Matilda, I know all too well there is no good way to have this sort of conversation.&#x201d; <br>Matilda and I were not close friends, but our political beliefs, particularly those regarding suffrage, had thrown us together at meetings of the Women&#x2019;s Liberal Federation. We had worked to educate and enlighten the women in the district about their rights&#x2014;that is, the rights we both believed they should have&#x2014;and had organized several rallies on our estates. Our success could only be described as limited. While the women were captivated and energized, their husbands reacted to the issues with somewhat less enthusiasm. Through it all, our interactions had not escalated much beyond that of two business acquaintances. Nonetheless, it was appropriate that I, not my husband, speak to her about her cousin. <br>&#x201c;Shall I bring her back here?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;She has a house full of guests whom I imagine the police will want to interview. It might be nicer for her to be in somewhat quieter surroundings.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; Colin said. &#x201c;She may also wish to see Scolfield.&#x201d; <br>I shuddered. Colin gave me a quick kiss, and I set off, dread consuming me. I would never grow comfortable with the task of informing someone of the violent death of a loved one. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Matilda Scolfield&#x2019;s grandfather, the previous Marquess of Montagu, had outlived Matilda&#x2019;s father, making her cousin Archibald next in line for the title. The old man had not seen fit to settle upon his heir the significant fortune he had amassed during his lifetime. Instead, he left his money, a house in London, two in Scotland, and a seaside cottage on the southern coast to his favorite granddaughter. The only part of his estate entailed was Montagu Manor itself, and that was all Archibald got. This had proved no hardship to him, as he stood to inherit a sizable sum from his parents and was already the recipient of a generous allowance. He was a capable young man, cheerful and eager, who had distinguished himself well enough at Oxford (knowing himself incapable of getting a first, he avoided the dreaded second and secured the third that perfectly reflected his academic ambitions) and now devoted much of his time to sport, earning a reputation as a fine rower. <i>Had devoted much of his time.</i> I reminded myself it was now necessary to use the past tense when referring to Archibald Scolfield. <br>A festive atmosphere still filled Montagu Manor when I arrived, no one inside knowing yet of its owner&#x2019;s demise. I asked the butler to take me somewhere where I could speak privately to Matilda and informed her of the tragedy in the gentlest way I could. Her countenance did not change as I spoke, but a slight gasp escaped her lips. Maintaining her composure in the manner of ...</p><h2>In Search of Wisdom: Faith Formation in the Black Church</h2><p><p>A guide for pastors, church leaders, and all who help African Americans in their search for a meaningful Christian lifestyle. </p> <p>Forming Christians--leading fallen and flawed human beings into the path of discipleship to a crucified and risen Lord--is one of the central, if not the central, tasks of all Christian churches. It is a difficult enough task anywhere, but for African Americans, beset by racial conflict, personal crises, generational separation, and other concerns, it is especially so. African American churches must work particularly hard to counter the messages their members receive from the dominant and often unfriendly culture. </p> <p>This book employs the biblical text and African tradition to draw on the idea of the search for wisdom as a potent way to help African Americans in their pursuit of genuine Christian discipleship. Wisdom in African American tradition is not simply knowledge; rather, it is those insights, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors,and practices that create and sustain a life of hope and that produce an inherent sense of the worth of one's self. If their members are to engage in the search for wisdom, African American churches must build an intentional ministry of faith formation. Wisdom can be gained, the authors argue, when African Americans listen to the black oral tradition with its proverbial sayings, revered Bible stories, songs, and narratives from the lives of exemplary individuals. The book offers several similar avenues for the search for wisdom, including helpful models of black males mentoring younger black males, as a remedy to the destructive effects that contemporary culture has on this segment of the African American community.</p></p><p>Anne E.

What is it about Christianity that has allowed it to be both a bane and a blessing for black people? Douglas examines the various &#34;distortions&#34; in early Christianity--particularly the influence of platonic dualism, with its denigration of the body, and the alliance with imperial power. She shows how this later helped support white racism, just as it later fed homophobia and other distortions in the black church. Nevertheless, she ends by sharing an inspiring account of her own Christian faith, and why she is still a Christian.</p><p><b>Rev.

Yarnall concludes with a discussion of work by Margaret Atwood and Eudora Welty in which the enchantress at last speaks in her own voice: that of a woman isolated by, but unashamed of, her power.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>The ancient goddess Circe is best remembered as the enchantress who tempted the mighty Odysseus and turned some of his unfortunate crew into swine in Homer's Odyssey . In this work, Yarnall (literature, Johnson State Coll., Vt.) examines the goddess's role in the Odyssey , as well as her appearance in various other literary works throughout history. The author suggests that Circe is an archetypal character associated with human vulnerability and feminine sexual attractiveness.

Look at the autmobiles he's driven over the years. Many of those were assembled using the same basic method employed for <i>The Green Red Green</i>: by welding together the surviving bits of some old wrecks. In this case, we're talking about the three Red Geen books published long ago by other, inferior publishers: <i>Duct Tape Is Not Enough</i>, a collection of newspaper columns by Red Green's alter-ego Steve Smith on surviving middle age; <i>Red Green Talks Cars</i>; and Red's literary debut <i>The Red Green Book</i>, a souvenir of the TV show.<br><br>The selection for his best-of pretty much made itself. Out went the Steve Smith columns with once-topical references; out went the material from <i>The Red Green Book</i> that was in the voices of the other characters (he's been carrying those bums for too long) and out went very little from the perenially hilarious <i>Cars.</i> The resulting mass of pieces have been well-shaken into a new mix; re-edited to new levels of sharpness and hilarity, and updated so that, for example, jokes about hairstyles now feature Russell Brand and not Rod Stewart. And the perfectly competent illustrations from the previous books have been replaced by much better, incompetent ones by the author, so that the look of this book very much resembles <i>How to Do Everything</i>.</p></p><p>RED GREEN is the leader of Possum Lodge, Chapter 11, a northern Ontario eyesore. He is friendly, inventive, cheap and as honest as the day is long, which means he's the least honest on December 21. When he works on his handyman projects, Red is not stupid, he's impatient. So he uses duct tape to "buy time." <br><br>Red Green is the star of <i>The Red Green Show</i>, which had first runs in Canada and the US from 1991 until 2006, making it the longest running live-action scripted comedy in the world. It continues to be enormously popular in reruns here and in the States. Red Green is the creation of Canadian comedian and writer Steve Smith. The author lives in Possum Lodge, Ontario.&#x201c;When looking for wisdom on big questions, I turn to either the Bible or Red Green. <br>&#x2014;<b> </b>Ken Gallinger, Ethically Speaking columnist, <i>Toronto Star</i></p><h2>The Gods of Gotham (A Timothy Wilde Novel)</h2><p><b>One of <i>Publishers Weekly'</i>s<i> </i>Top Ten Mystery/Thrillers of the Year<br>One of <i>Kirkus Reviews' </i>Ten Best Crime Novels of the Year<br>One of Gillian Flynn's "Recommendations for the Season" on <i>Today</i><br>Edgar(R) Award Nominee for Best Novel<br>ALA Reading List&nbsp;Award for Best Mystery<br><br>1845: New York City forms its first police force.

Re-creating New York City circa 1845. The question I ask is, Why then? But what I am really asking is why you took the difficult path. Why not New York in 1945, or even now? I read this book and from the writer&#x2019;s standpoint, kept asking myself, Why did she take this path? Wow!</p> <p><b>Lyndsay Faye</b>: Ha! Yes, absolutely&#x2014;in a certain sense, the project was very difficult. My hubris in trying to write a novel set in 1845 New York was about the fact that I specifically wanted to do day one, cop one of the NYPD. Origin stories are very compelling. And when you think about how renowned the world over the NYPD is today, for reasons both positive and negative but all of them highly dramatic, you find yourself wondering what such an organization looked like at inception. It&#x2019;s almost mythical, the fame they&#x2019;ve achieved and the advances they&#x2019;ve made, and I was deeply curious to know how they started out. I wanted to take a historical event and turn it into a legend, in the sense of making something iconic and resonant, and when I discovered that the NYPD was founded in 1845, my time period chose itself.</p> <p>In another sense, I should add that I was once on a library panel where a very clever author said we don&#x2019;t write historicals to choose the difficult path, but rather the lazy one. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to commit a decent crime these days, what with CCTV and the Internet and credit-card tracking and forensics and ballistics and security cameras and such everywhere. I have a simple bachelor&#x2019;s in English lit, not an advanced degree in criminal science, and to be honest, I find the complexity of modern-day crime solving much more intimidating when it comes to plot. I know that TV shows like CSI, etc., make it all look more magical than it is in fact, but I&#x2019;m interested in how people solved crimes before forensics was even a line of study. How did the first cops go about it? What tools did they employ? I greatly enjoy reading modern mysteries, but I&#x2019;m constantly staggered by the omnivorous technical know-how they require. </p> <p><b>MC</b>: What&#x2019;s most impressive about this work is how the world of New York is so full and real. Can you walk us through the research that goes into a project like this? How long were you putting this part together before you actually sat down to write the book, or do both things happen at the same time?</p> <p><b>LF</b>: Thank you very much indeed&#x2014;I want all of my historical fiction to be an immersive experience, so to create that effect, I bury myself in the world in question for at least six months before embarking on a first draft. This time around, that meant poring over diaries, setting up my own tent shanty in the New-York Historical Society, camping out with a cookstove in the Bryant Park extension of the New York Public Library&#x2019;s microfilm department, etc. Syntax and fashion and food and architecture and all the other aspects of the culture fascinate me, so I try to soak it all in like a big fluffy pancake. It&#x2019;s irritating for me to be constantly looking up facts or grasping at vernacular as I&#x2019;m writing, so I&#x2019;ve learned to spend half a year at research first. It saves me time in the long run.</p> <p>My research includes history books, always, but original sources are ultimately much more important to me. I read all of the <em>Herald</em> newspaper from January 1st through December 31st for 1845, for instance. Countless people wrote travelogues and social essays and satires in nineteenth-century New York, and those were invaluable. I wanted to know what the people of the time period thought about their city, their politics, their lifestyle. What did they think and say about race? Religion? Where to get the best oyster pie? How that uppity tart cousin of theirs looked at the fireman&#x2019;s ball last night? That journey of discovery is always a fabulous one.</p> <p><b>MC</b>: I think it&#x2019;s easy in a historical novel to make the time and place the star&#x2014;to sort of wow &#x2019;em with your research. That usually leaves the story short on character. You escaped that pitfall with a host of characters, leading with Timothy Wilde. It seems that equal preparation went into Wilde as did into your historical research. Can you say where Wilde comes from?</p> <p><b>LF</b>: See, this is something I love talking about, because historical fiction that shows off the research involved rather dismays me. The author presents you with a narrator who is, for example, a tavern girl. She&#x2019;s plucky and wonderful and when running for her life from sinister guardsmen, she stops to tell you that the building she&#x2019;s racing past was erected in 1814, by whom, with what variety of stone. I&#x2019;m exaggerating, but I make it a principle not to include any information that my characters wouldn&#x2019;t find relevant. Or I try my best to avoid it.</p> <p>So it&#x2019;s very fair to say that as much effort goes into my characters as into the world around them. Tim is culled from multiple sources. To name a few, when I realized that the early NYPD was inextricably tied up in politics, I determined that I wanted him to be an outsider with his own set of principles, yet I still wanted him to be highly competent. I was in the restaurant business for ten years; my husband and many of my closest friends are bartenders, and you ought to be aware that they know more about you than you suppose. Barkeeps are keen observers, and I realized that a former career in an oyster cellar would be grand training for the NYPD. Tim&#x2019;s physical appearance is more or less based on a dear actor friend of mine I used to work with when I did musical theater. Many bits of Timothy are, of course, me. Fountains that don&#x2019;t work make me irrationally annoyed; they annoy Tim, too. Finally, my favorite aspects of Tim are those sort of alchemical moments when a character you&#x2019;re imagining takes on a life of his or her own.</p> <p><b>MC</b>: It was pure genius to anchor this story in two significant events&#x2014;the potato famine and the founding of the New York Police Department. There is probably substantial documentation of these two things. How do you take them and blend them into fiction? Were you a slave to drama or a slave to the facts/truths of that time? </p> <p><b>LF</b>: The historical confluence of the Great Famine and the inaugural year of the NYPD was a gift of twenty-four-karat writerly gold. If I&#x2019;d found a genie on a beach and asked it for ideal dramatic material, I couldn&#x2019;t have done better. That was 100 percent luck, actually&#x2014;I was researching the first cops, and then I found that the potato blight had just been discovered the previous year in Europe, and that thousands upon thousands of Irish were fleeing their homeland. &#x201c;Native&#x201d; New Yorkers were up in arms about emigrants ruining their democracy in the name of the Antichrist of Rome, all that unfortunate hyperbolic political grandstanding that happens when too many people want the same resources. It was total chaos, and it changed the face New York City society.</p> <p>Blending the stories of the copper stars and of the emigrants was a challenge, but a riveting one for me. As you say, both the potato famine and the first police force are well documented. I was a slave to the facts in the sense that I wanted to do as much justice as possible to my ancestors, who were seeking new lives in what turned out to be a hostile environment. The influx of Irish refugees continued for quite some time, so I&#x2019;d copious material to cull from. It became very real for me. The chapter titles all feature a quote from the time period, for instance, to help us bear in mind that poverty and religious bigotry and corruption were rampant and real. The thin line between success and despair they walked is as shocking and relevant today as it was then, so by virtue of being a slave to the facts, I managed to be a slave to the drama simultaneously. </p> <p><b>MC</b>: Your last novel, <em>Dust and Shadow</em>, also blended fiction and fact&#x2014;Jack the Ripper&#x2014;and historical research. Aside from these two very large, real events that we start with in <em>TGOG</em>, was there a smaller, true incident that inspired this story?</p> <p><b>LF</b>: Yes, indeed. The story of Eliza Rafferty and her infanticide was entirely true&#x2014;it took place in 1849 in a house at number 6 Doyer Street. When I read about her distress and incomprehension after killing her own child, I set myself the gruesome task of finding out what sort of life could inspire such an act. The neighbors were rightly shocked by the baby&#x2019;s death, the police appalled. Today I think we&#x2019;d term her state a psychotic form of severe postpartum depression, but apart from lacking modern medicine to save her and her child, she probably lacked everything else as well&#x2014;ample space, adequate food, any sort of safety net whatsoever.

It takes place six months later, in the winter of 1846. Timothy and Valentine have quite a bit of baggage to work through, after all, so I think it would be rather cruel not to give them a shot.

This volume explores Kollwitz&#x2019;s obsessive printmaking experiments with the evolution of her images, and assesses the unusually rich progressions of preparatory drawings, proofs, and rejected images behind Kollwitz&#x2019;s compositions of struggling workers, rebellious peasants, and grieving<br> mothers.<br> &nbsp;<br> This selected catalogue of the Dr. Richard A.

The meanings and sentiments emerging from Kollwitz&#x2019;s images are not, as is often implied, unmediated expressions of her politics and emotions. Rather, Kollwitz transformed images with deliberate technical and formal experiments, seemingly endless adjustments, wholesale rejections, and strategic regroupings of figures and forms&#x2014;all of which demonstrate that her obsessive dedication to making art was never a straightforward means to political or emotional ends.<br> &nbsp;<br> This volume is published to accompany an exhibition on view at the Getty Research Institute at the Getty Center December 3, 2019, to March 29, 2020 and at the Art Institute of Chicago May 30 to September 13, 2020.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Louis Marchesano is former curator of prints and drawings at the Getty Research Institute, and now the Audrey and William H.

The daughter of a Wilson &amp; Company millwright, Cheri Register recalls the 1959 meatpackers' strike that divided her hometown of Albert Lea, Minnesota. The violence that erupted when the company "replaced" its union workers with strikebreakers tested family loyalty and community stability. Register skillfully interweaves her own memories, historical research, and oral interviews into a narrative that is thoughtful and impassioned about the value of blue-collar work and the dignity of those who do it.</p></p><p>In 1959, meatpackers in the little Minnesota town of Albert Lea went on strike to demand better working conditions and higher rates of pay. The plant's owners brought in strikebreakers from nearby towns, violence ensued, the governor of Minnesota called in the National Guard, and for a few days news from Albert Lea filled papers around the United States.<p> The incident has long been forgotten, even by many local residents. Cheri Register, who was 14 years old at the time, is one who remembers it well. In this affecting memoir of working-class life, she pays homage to her father, who worked in the plant for 31 numbing years, earning 70 cents an hour when he started, a bit more than five dollars an hour when he retired. The work was dangerous and unpleasant, but still an improvement over the alternatives, for, as she writes, "My entire family failed at farming in one of the richest stretches of the corn belt, where water was so plentiful it had to be drained away and the soil so thick that geologists could find no exposed rock." </p><p> As she recounts the strike and her father's life, Register describes how the subsequent generational conflicts of the 1960s and her own aspirations divided her family. "To be successful," she writes, "which means free from grueling labor, the children of blue-collar families must be driven from home, away from the familiar and secure." Her book is both a homecoming and a welcome contribution to labor history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"Cheri Register, in her lovely, deeply moving memoir, has done more than resurrect a buried history of America&#x2019;s laboring people; in this instance, the bitter 1959-60 Wilson &amp; Co. packinghouse strike in Albert Lea, Minn. At a time in which the two major party candidates for President appealed to the "middle class," as though there were no other, Register gives rebirth to an old honored phrase in our daily vocabulary: working class. Yes, she is a Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy), but to me and, I hope, scores of thousands of readers, she is a Ph.D. (Packinghouse Daughter). This is must reading, especially for the young who have so long been short-changed in the knowledge of labor history." -- Studs Terkel</p><h2>Vita Nova</h2><p>Since, 1990, Louise Gl�ck has been exploring a form that is, according to poet Robert Hass, her invention. <i>Vita Nova</i> - like its immediate predecessors, a book-length sequence - combines the ecstatic utterance of <i>The Wild Iris</i> with the worldly dramas elaborated in <i>Meadowlands. Vita Nova</i> is a book that exists in the long moment of spring, a book of deaths and beginnings, resignation and hope, brutal, luminous, and farseeing. Like late Yeats, <i>Vita Nova</i> dares large statement. By turns stern interlocutor and ardent novitiate, Gl�ck compasses the essential human paradox, a terrifying act of perspective that brings into resolution the smallest human hope and the vast forces that shape and thwart it.</p><p>No poet has grafted her life more stubbornly to myth than Louise Gl�ck. In <i>Meadowlands</i>, this meant voyaging simultaneously through the <i>Odyssey</i> and the disintegration of her marriage; in <i>Vita Nova</i>, the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice provides a backdrop to the bitter aftermath of divorce. "No one wants to be the muse; / in the end, everyone wants to be Orpheus," Gl�ck pithily notes, but here, she assumes both voices--the grieving artist and his doubly silenced love. "How would you like to die / while Orpheus was singing? / A long death; all the way to Dis / I heard him," the nymph complains in "Relic," while in "Orfeo," the bard dwells almost lovingly on both his loss and his art: <blockquote> I have lost my Eurydice,<br> I have lost my lover,<br> and suddenly I am speaking French<br> and it seems to me I have never been in better voice;<br> it seems these songs<br> are songs of a high order.<br> </blockquote> In the end, of course, it's not Eurydice but his own pain that Orpheus immortalizes. "I made a harp of disaster / to perpetuate the beauty of my last love," Gl�ck admits, but this is less a matter of personal glory than it is of sheer survival. And besides, she reminds us, "sometimes / our consolations are the costliest thing."<p> Gl�ck is an excruciatingly honest poet, but not, exactly, a confessional one. <i>Vita Nova</i> holds her life at arm's length, examining its particulars with almost Olympian detachment. Several of these poems include a self-interrogation, rendered in a voice equal parts prosecutor and witness for the defense: "Ask her how he touched her." "Ask her what she remembers." "Ask her if the fire hurts," demands a speaker in "The Burning Heart." Is this Eurydice's story as accident report? S�ance? Cross-examination? Elsewhere, her troubles come rendered in a piercing gallows wit. In the volume's final poem, "Vita Nova" (the second of two with that same title), she dreams a dog, then dreams a custody fight with her ex. Be brave, she tells her hypothetical pet--"this is / all material; you'll wake up / in a different world, / you will eat again, you will grow up into a poet!" One senses that for Gl�ck, it's all material--marriage, divorce, life, death, even and especially the ancient drama of myth. These are poems of rebirth, but of a particular kind--not of hope, and certainly not of youth, but of something far more important: poetry itself. In "The Nest," as Gl�ck emerges from her grief, she feels her mind once again engage with the world, thinking "first, <i>I love it.</i> / Then, <i>I can use it.</i>" <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Louise Gl�ck won the Pulitzer Prize for <em>The Wild Iris</em> in 1993. The author of eight books of poetry and one collection of essays, <em>Proofs and Theories: Essays on Poetry,</em> she has received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry, the William Carlos Williams Award, and the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for Nonfiction. She was named the next U.S. poet laureate in August 2003. Her most recent book is <em>The Seven Ages</em>.

Leo would spend the next five years in a coke processing plant, shoveling coal, lugging bricks, mixing mortar, and battling the relentless calculus of hunger that governed the labor colony: one shovel load of coal is worth one gram of bread. <br>In <i>The Hunger Angel</i>, Nobel laureate Herta M�ller calls upon her unique combination of poetic intensity and dispassionate precision to conjure the distorted world of the labor camp in all its physical and moral absurdity. She has given Leo the language to express the inexpressible, as hunger sharpens his senses into an acuity that is both hallucinatory and profound. In scene after disorienting scene, the most ordinary objects accrue tender poignancy as they acquire new purpose&#x2015;a gramophone box serves as a suitcase, a handkerchief becomes a talisman, an enormous piece of casing pipe functions as a lovers' trysting place. The heart is reduced to a pump, the breath mechanized to the rhythm of a swinging shovel, and coal, sand, and snow have a will of their own. Hunger becomes an insatiable angel who haunts the camp, but also a bare-knuckled sparring partner, delivering blows that keep Leo feeling the rawest connection to life. <br>M�ller has distilled Leo's struggle into words of breathtaking intensity that take us on a journey far beyond the Gulag and into the depths of one man's soul.</p></p><p><b>Herta M�ller</b> is the winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature, as well as the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and the European Literature Prize. She is the author of, among other books, <i>The Land of Green Plums</i> and <i>The Appointment</i>. Born in Romania in 1953, M�ller lost her job as a teacher and suffered repeated threats after refusing to cooperate with Ceausescu's secret police. She succeeded in emigrating in 1987 and now lives in Berlin.<b>On packing suitcases</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>All that I have I carry on me.<br>Or: All that is mine I carry with me.<br>I carried all I had, but it wasn&#x2019;t mine. Everything either came from someone else or wasn&#x2019;t what it was supposed to be. A gramophone box served as a pigskin suitcase. The light overcoat came from my father. The fancy coat with the velvet collar from my grandfather. The knickers from Uncle Edwin. The leather gaiters came from our neighbor Herr Carp, the green woolen gloves from Aunt Fini. Only the burgundy silk scarf and the toilet kit belonged to me, presents from the previous Christmas.<br>The war was still on in January 1945. In their dismay at my being shipped off in the dead of winter to who knows where in Russia, everyone wanted to give me something that might be of use, even if it couldn&#x2019;t help. Because nothing in the world could possibly help: I was on the Russians&#x2019; list, and that was that. So everyone gave me something, and kept their thoughts to themselves. And I took what they gave. I was seventeen years old, and in my mind this going away couldn&#x2019;t have come at a better time. Not that I needed the Russians&#x2019; list, but if things didn&#x2019;t turn out too badly, I thought, this leaving might even be a good thing. I wanted to get out of our thimble of a town, where every stone had eyes. Instead of fear I felt a secret impatience. And I had a bad conscience about it, because the same list that caused my relatives such despair was fine with me. They were afraid something might happen to me in a foreign country. I simply wanted to go to a place that didn&#x2019;t know who I was.<br>Something had just happened to me. Something forbidden. Something strange, filthy, shameless, and beautiful. It happened in the Alder Park, far in the back, on the other side of the short-grass mounds. Afterward, on my way home, I went to the pavilion in the middle of the park where the bands played on holidays. I sat there a while. Sunlight came stabbing through the finely carved wood. I stared at the empty circles, squares, and trapezoids, held together by white tendrils with claws, and I saw their fear. This was the pattern of my aberration, of the horror on my mother&#x2019;s face. In the pavilion I vowed: I&#x2019;m never coming back to this park.<br>But the more I tried to stop myself, the faster I went back&#x2014;after two days. For a rendezvous, as it was known in the park.<br>That next rendezvous was with the same first man. He was called THE SWALLOW. The second man was new, his name was THE FIR. The third was THE EAR. Then came THE THREAD. Then ORIOLE and CAP. Later HARE, CAT, GULL. Then THE PEARL. Only we knew which name belonged to whom. The park was a wild animal crossing, I let myself be passed from one man to the next. And it was summer with white skin on birch trees and shrubs of elderberry and mock orange leafing out to form an impenetrable wall of green.<br>Love has its seasons. Autumn brought an end to the park. The trees grew naked, and we moved our rendezvous to the Neptune Baths. An oval sign with a swan hung next to the iron gate. Every week I met up with a married man twice my age. He was Romanian. I won&#x2019;t say what name he used or what name I used. We staggered our arrivals, so that no one and nothing could have any idea that we&#x2019;d arranged to meet: not the cashier ensconced in the leaded-glass windows of her booth, nor the shiny stone floor, nor the rounded middle column, nor the water-lily tiles on the wall, nor the carved wooden stairs. We swam in the pool with all the others and didn&#x2019;t come together until we were both in the sauna.<br>Back then, before my time in the camp as well as after I returned, and all the way up to 1968 when I left the country, every rendezvous could have landed me in prison. Minimum five years, if I&#x2019;d been caught. Some were. They went straight from the park or the baths to a brutal interrogation and then to jail. And from there to the penal colony on the canal. Today I know that almost nobody came back from there. The ones who did were walking corpses&#x2014;old before their time and broken, of no use for any love in the world.<br>And in the camp&#x2014;if I&#x2019;d been caught in the camp I&#x2019;d be dead.<br>After those five camp years I roamed the busy streets, day in and day out, silently rehearsing what to say in case I was arrested, preparing a thousand excuses and alibis to counter the verdict: CAUGHT IN THE ACT. I carry silent baggage. I have packed myself into silence so deeply and for so long that I can never unpack myself using words. When I speak, I only pack myself a little differently.<br>Once during the last rendezvous-summer I took a long way home from the park and found myself near the Holy Trinity Church on the main square. This chance detour turned out to be significant: I saw the time that was coming. On a column next to the side-altar stood a saint in a gray cloak, with a sheep draped around his neck as a collar. This sheep draped around the neck is silence. There are things we do not speak of. But I know what I&#x2019;m talking about when I say that silence around the neck is different from silence inside the mouth. Before, during, and after my time in the camp, for twenty-five years, I lived in fear&#x2014;of my family and of the state. Fear of a double disgrace: that the state would lock me away as a criminal and that my family would disown me out of shame. On crowded streets I would stare at the glass panes of the shops, at the windows of streetcars, of houses, I would gaze into fountains and puddles&#x2014;checking to make sure I wasn&#x2019;t transparent after all.<br>My father was an art teacher. With the Neptune Baths inside my head, whenever he used the word WATERCOLOR I&#x2019;d flinch as though he&#x2019;d kicked me. The words knew how far I&#x2019;d already gone. At the dinner table my mother said: Don&#x2019;t stab the potato with your fork because it will fall apart, use your spoon, the fork is for meat. My temples were throbbing. Why is she saying meat when she&#x2019;s talking about forks and potatoes. What kind of meat does she mean. I was my own thief, the words came out of nowhere and caught me.<br>Like all the Germans in our little town, my mother, and especially my father, believed in the beauty of blond braids and white knee-stockings. They believed in the black square of Hitler&#x2019;s mustache and in the Aryan heritage of us Transylvanian Saxons. The physical part of my secret alone was a gross abomination. And with a Romanian there was the additional matter of <i>Rassenschande</i>.<br>I wanted to escape from my family, to a camp if need be. But I felt sorry for my mother, who had no idea how little she knew me. And who would think of me more frequently when I was away than I of her.<br>Inside the church, next to the saint with the sheep of silence, I had seen the white alcove with the inscription: HEAVEN SETS TIME IN MOTION. Packing my suitcase, I thought: The white alcove has done its work. This is the time that&#x2019;s been set in motion. I was also happy I wasn&#x2019;t being sent off to war, into the snow at the front. Foolishly brave and obedient, I went on packing. And I took whatever was offered&#x2014;leather gaiters with laces, knickers, the coat with the velvet collar&#x2014;even though none of it was really right for me. Because this wasn&#x2019;t about clothes, but about the time that had been set in motion, about growing up, with one set of things or another. The world is not a costume ball, I thought, and no one who&#x2019;s forced to go to Russia in the dead of winter need worry about looking ridiculous.<br>A patrol consisting of two policemen&#x2014;a Romanian and a Russian&#x2014;went from house to house carrying a list. I no longer remember whether the word CAMP was uttered inside our home. Or what other word might have been spoken, except RUSSIA. If the word CAMP was mentioned, it didn&#x2019;t frighten me. Despite the war and the silence about my rendezvous draped around my neck, I was only seventeen years old and still living in my bright, silly childhood. The words WATERCOLOR and MEAT affected me. My brain didn&#x2019;t register the word CAMP.<br>Back then, at the table with the fork and potatoes, when my mother caught me with the word meat, I remembered how she used to shout down to the courtyard where I was playing: If you don&#x2019;t come to dinner right away, if I have to call you one more time, you can just stay where you are. But I didn&#x2019;t always come right away, and once, when I finally went upstairs, she said:<br>Why don&#x2019;t you just pack your satchel and go out into the world and do whatever you want. She pulled me into my room, grabbed my woolen cap and my jacket, and stuffed them inside my little backpack. I said, But I&#x2019;m your child, where am I supposed to go.<br>A lot of people think packing a suitcase is something you learn through practice, like singing or praying. We had no practice and no suitcase. When my father was sent to join the Romanian soldiers on the front, there was nothing to pack. Soldiers are given everything they need, it&#x2019;s all part of the uniform. But we had no idea what we were packing for, except a long journey and a cold place. If you don&#x2019;t have the right things, you improvise. The wrong things become necessary. Then the necessary things turn out to be the only right things, simply because they&#x2019;re what you have.<br>My mother brought the gramophone from the living room and set it on the kitchen table. Using a screwdriver, I made it into a suitcase. First I took out the spindle and turntable. Then I corked up the hole for the crank. The fox-red velvet lining stayed. I also kept the triangular emblem with HIS MASTER&#x2019;S VOICE and the dog facing the horn. I put four books on the bottom: a cloth-bound edition of <i>Faust</i>, the slim volume of Weinheber, <i>Zarathustra</i>, and my anthology of poems from eight centuries. No novels, since you just read them once and never again. After the books came my toilet kit, containing: 1 bottle eau de toilette, 1 bottle Tarr aftershave, 1 shaving soap, 1 razor, 1 shaving ...</p><h2>Weight: The Myth of Atlas and Heracles (The Myths)</h2><p>With wit and verve, the prize-winning author of <i>Sexing the Cherry</i> and <i>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit</i> brings the mythical figure of Atlas into the space age and sets him free at last. In her retelling of the story of a god tricked into holding the world on his shoulders and his brief reprieve, she sets difficult questions about the nature of choice and coercion, how we choose our own destiny and at the same time can liberate ourselves from our seeming fate. Finally in paperback, <i>Weight</i> is a daring, seductive addition to Canongate&#x2019;s ambitious series of myths by the world&#x2019;s most acclaimed authors.</p><p>Jeanette Winterson&#x2019;s first novel, Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, won the Whitbread Prize for Best Novel. Since then, she has published seven other novels, including Lighthousekeeping, The Passion, Written on the Body, and The Powerbook, a collection of short stories, The World and Other Places, a books of essays, Art Objects, and most recently a children&#x2019;s picture book, The King of Capri. She has adapted her work for TV, film, and stage. Her books are published in thirty-two countries. She lives in Oxfordshire and London.I want to tell the story again<br>The free man never thinks of escape.<br>In the beginning there was nothing. Not even space and time. You could have thrown the universe at me and I would have caught it in one hand. There was no universe. It was easy to bear.<br><br>This happy nothing ended fifteen aeons ago. It was a strange time, and what I know is told to me in radioactive whispers; that&#x2019;s all there is left of one great shout into the silence.<br><br>What is it that you contain? The dead. Time. Light patterns of millennia opening in your gut. Every minute, in each of you, a few million potassium atoms succumb to radioactive decay. The energy that powers these tiny atomic events has been locked inside potassium atoms ever since a star-sized bomb exploded nothing into being. Potassium, like uranium and radium, is a long-lived radioactive nuclear waste of the supernova bang that accounts for you.<br><br>Your first parent was a star.<br><br>It was hot as hell in those days. It was Hell, if hell is where the life we love cannot exist. Those ceaseless burning fires and volcanic torments are lodged in us as ultimate fear. The hells we invent are the hells we have known. Hell is; was not, is not, cannot. Science calls it the world before life began &#x2014; the Hadean period. But life had begun, because life is more than the ability to reproduce. In the molten lava spills and cratered rocks, life longed for life. <i>The proto, the almost, the maybe</i>. Not Venus. Not Mars. Earth.<br><br>Planet Earth, that wanted life so badly, she got it.<br><br>Moving forward a few billion years, there was a miracle. At least that&#x2019;s what I call the unexpected fact that changes the story. Earth had bacterial life, but no oxygen, and oxygen was a deadly poison. Then, in a quiet revolution as explosive in its own way as a star, a new kind of bacteria, cyanobacteria started to photosynthesise &#x2014; and a bi-product of photosynthesis is oxygen. Planet earth had a new atmosphere. The rest is history.<br><br>Well not quite. I could list for you the wild optimism of the Cambrian era, pushing up mountains like grass grows daisies, or the Silurian dream-days of starfish and gastropods. About 400 million years ago, shaking salt water from their fins and scales, the first land animals climbed out of the warm lagoons of the vast coral reefs. The Triassic and Jurassic periods belong to the dinosaurs, efficient murder weapons, common as nightmares. Then three or four million years ago &#x2014; chancy and brand new &#x2014; what&#x2019;s this come here &#x2014; a mammoth and something like a man?<br>* * *<br>The earth was amazed. Earth was always strange and new to herself. She never anticipated what she would do next. She never guessed the coming wonder. She loved the risk, the randomness, the lottery probability of a winner. We forget, but she never did, that what we take for granted is the success story. The failures have disappeared. This planet that seems so obvious and inevitable is the jackpot. Earth is the blue ball with the winning number on it.<br><br>Make a list. Look around you. <i>Rock, sand, soil, fruit trees, roses, spiders, snails, frogs, fish, cattle, horses, rainfall, sunshine, you and me</i>. This is the grand experiment called life. What could be more unexpected?<br><br>All the stories are here, silt-packed and fossil-stored. The book of the world opens anywhere, chronology is one method only and not the best. Clocks are not time. Even radioactive rock-clocks, even gut-spun DNA, can only tell time like a story.<br><br>When the universe exploded like a bomb, it started ticking like a bomb too. We know our sun will die, in another hundred million years or so, then the lights will go out and there will be no light to read by any more.<br><br>&#x2018;Tell me the time&#x2019; you say.

My mother was the Earth.<br>My father loved the strong outlines of my mother&#x2019;s body. He loved her demarcations and her boundaries. He knew where he stood with her. She was solid, certain, shaped and material.<br><br>My mother loved my father because he recognised no boundaries. His ambitions were tidal. He swept, he sank, he flooded, he re-formed. Poseidon was a deluge of a man. Power flowed off him. He was deep, sometimes calm, but never still.<br><br>My mother and father teemed with life. They were life. Creation depended on them and had done so before there was air or fire. They sustained so much. They were so much. To each other they were irresistible.<br><br>Both were volatile. My father obviously so, my mother more alarmingly. She was serene as a rock but volcano&#x2019;d with anger. She was quiet as a desert but tectonically challenged. When my mother threw a plate across the room, the whole world felt the crash. My father could be whipped into a storm in moments. My mother grumbled and growled and shook for days or weeks or months until her rage fissured and crumpled entire cities or forced human kind into lava-like submission.<br><br><i>Humankind</i> . . . They never could see it coming. Look at Pompeii. There they are in the bathouses, sitting in their chairs, wearing skeletal looks of charred surprise.<br><br>When my father wooed my mother she lapped it up. He was playful, he was warm, he waited for her in the bright blue shallows and came a little closer, then drew back, and his pull was to leave a little gift on her shore; a piece of coral, mother of pearl, a shell as spiralled as a dream.<br><br>Sometimes he was a long way out and she missed him and the beached fishes gasped for breath. Then he was all over her again, and they were mermaids together, because there was always something feminine about my father, for all his power. Earth and water are the same kind, just as fire and air are their opposites.<br><br>She loved him because he showed her to herself. He was her moving mirror. He took her round the world, the world that she was, and held it up for her to see, her beauty of forests and cliffs and coastlines and wild places. To him she was both paradise and fear and he loved both. Together they went where no human had ever been. Places only they could go, places only they could be. Wherever he went, she was there; a gentle restraint, a serious reminder; <i>the earth and the waters that covered the earth</i>. He knew though, that while he could not cover the whole of her, she underpinned the whole of him. For all his strength, she was strong.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Daylighters</h2><p><b>While Morganville, Texas, is often a troubled town, Claire Danvers and her friends are looking forward to coming home.

It&#x2019;s got secrets. It&#x2019;s a company town . . . and the company is vampires. If you stay, you work for them, signing special agreements for Protection and paying a tax in earnings or blood for the privilege of not being, y&#x2019;know, eaten.</p><p>It&#x2019;s worked for a couple of centuries under the iron-in-velvet touch of the Founder, Amelie . . . but the past few years have been turmoil, trouble, and rebellion. Claire Danvers left to get away from it all, embarking on a special study program at MIT. But even if you can take the girl out of Morganville, you can&#x2019;t take Morganville out of the girl&#x2014;and she ran headlong into a menacing new enemy who knew way too much about vampires. The Daylight Foundation. </p><p>Now Claire&#x2019;s returning home with her housemates (Eve, Michael, and Shane) and her allies (her bipolar mad scientist boss, Myrnin; Amelie&#x2019;s ex-second-in-command, Oliver; Claire&#x2019;s new vampire friend, Jesse) and Dr. Anderson, a captive scientist who was once a Morganville native, now turned traitor. </p><p>But home sure isn&#x2019;t the way they left it. . . . </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>ONE</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Claire stared at the creaking billboard that marked the town limits of Morganville, Texas, and thought, I ought to be crying. Her best friend, Eve, already was, in helpless, furious sobs. Claire held on to her and did all the sympathetic things right&#x2014; murmured that it would be okay, patted her on the back, hugged her.</p><p>&nbsp;But although she said all the right things, she felt . . . empty. Dry as the sand that blew through the desert outside the police cruiser&#x2019;s windows. They were sitting in the backseat, behind steel mesh, and the doors wouldn&#x2019;t open from the inside. The cruiser was made like a taxi, but it most definitely wasn&#x2019;t one since it took you only where you didn&#x2019;t want to go. Namely, to jail. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And across from where their cruiser was parked, four limp vampire bodies were being loaded into two of the town&#x2019;s ambulances&#x2014;</p><p>Strapped tightly to gurneys, in case the wood still buried in their</p><p>hearts to keep them temporarily dead didn&#x2019;t work. Claire identified</p><p>the slack faces as they were rolled by: Oliver, once town Founder Amelie&#x2019;s second-in-command, now disgraced and in exile. Jesse, the vamp who Claire knew the least well, a beautiful woman who looked ridiculously young and fragile now, robbed (temporarily, hopefully) of her vampire life. Then Myrnin, Claire&#x2019;s bipolar vampire boss and friend, his dark hair an untamed mess around his still, white face.</p><p>Finally, and most horribly, Michael Glass, Claire&#x2019;s friend and the love of Eve&#x2019;s life. His skin had turned the color of pure white marble, and his blue eyes were open and dull. He looked deadest of them all. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Claire whispered, making sure to keep Eve&#x2019;s face turned away as Michael&#x2019;s body was rolled past. &#x201c;Vampires can shake this off. It&#x2019;s no problem for them as long as the arrows come out soon; they&#x2019;re not leaving them in the sun or anything. Just breathe, okay? Breathe.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t so much what she was saying as the fact that her voice was steady and calm, a lifeline in a tossing ocean of chaos. </p><p>Eve took a deep breath, and her sobbing slowed and hitched to a stop. She sat back as the ambulance doors slammed shut and one after the other the big vehicles pulled away onto the two-lane blacktop heading toward downtown Morganville&#x2014;if Morganville had anything that could be described as a downtown. She wiped her eyes on the back of her hand, smearing what little eye makeup she had left. The glitter of her ruby wedding ring caught the light, and for a moment Claire&#x2019;s wall of numbness shuddered and threatened to collapse to reveal the pain and fear she&#x2019;d hidden behind it. &#x201c;Did you see Michael?&#x201d; Eve asked. She caught her breath on another sob, and her reddened eyes held Claire&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Did he look okay?&#x201d; </p><p>Claire couldn&#x2019;t say that, because the sight of his icy skin and blank eyes had thoroughly unnerved her. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be fine. You know he&#x2019;s tougher than this,&#x201d; she said. Which was a totally true thing, and beyond any argument. </p><p>&#x201c;I know&#x2014;God, why did this happen? What do they want from us?&#x201d; </p><p>Eve said it as a rhetorical wail, but it was the question that churned in Claire&#x2019;s mind over and over. Why? They&#x2019;d been heading back to Morganville to warn Amelie about several things, not the least of which was the deadly growth of an anti-vampire organization called the Daylight Foundation&#x2014;and the fact that one of Amelie&#x2019;s most trusted agents, Dr. Irene Anderson (once of Morganville), had joined the other side. </p><p>But they&#x2019;d been met by the local police instead of Amelie&#x2019;s people, and things had gone downhill from there. The cops had first separated out the humans&#x2014;Claire, Eve, and Claire&#x2019;s boyfriend, Shane, plus the prisoner, Dr. Anderson. Then, without any warning, they&#x2019;d taken down their vampire friends, who had just been wheeled into the ambulances and driven off to fates unknown. </p><p>Claire twisted in the seat to look into the car behind them. The cops hadn&#x2019;t had an easy time getting Shane into the other cruiser; they&#x2019;d ended up handcuffing him and threatening a Tasering. He sat stiffly in the backseat, staring holes into the distance as if it were in for a beating. Next to him, Dr. Anderson slumped against the window as though she didn&#x2019;t care whose prisoner she was anymore. </p><p>Claire knew why they&#x2019;d separated her from Shane, and she knew that Eve needed her right now, but she wanted desperately to be with him and to ask all the questions burning in her mind. Why would Hannah Moses do this? After all, Police Chief Moses was their ally, their good and trusted friend. But she&#x2019;d shown no hesitation, no re�morse. The only way to interpret what had just happened was that Hannah had freely and willingly joined the Daylight Foundation. </p><p>Nothing was making any sense, and Claire needed it to make sense so badly. Humans have taken control of Morganville, Hannah had told her, as their friends&#x2014;their mutual friends&#x2014;lay still on the ground. Vampires are being quarantined for their own protection.</p><p>It couldn&#x2019;t be true. It just . . . couldn&#x2019;t. And yet it so obviously was. </p><p>&#x201c;Where are they taking him?&#x201d; Eve was staring after the flash�ing lights of the departing ambulances. &#x201c;She said something about quarantine. What does that mean? Do you think they&#x2019;re taking them to the hospital? Do they think they have some kind of dis�ease?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Claire said. She felt helpless, and she knew if she let herself feel anything, she&#x2019;d be just as angry as Shane looked sitting in that other cruiser. He seemed ready to chew through the steel mesh. But if she got angry, she would also have to let in every�thing else, all the other emotions that bubbled and threatened in�side her. And if she did that, she would collapse, like Eve was doing. </p><p>Better not to feel anything right now. Better to stay strong. </p><p>The driver&#x2019;s-side door opened, and Hannah Moses got behind the wheel of the police car. She settled in and buckled her safety belt in one smooth motion. A deputy got in on the other side&#x2014; new, Claire thought. Someone she didn&#x2019;t know. </p><p>But she did recognize the pin he wore on the collar of his uniform&#x2014;a rising sun, in gold. </p><p>Symbol of the Daylight Foundation. </p><p>Eve lunged forward and grabbed the mesh, threading her fin�gertips into it as Hannah started the engine of the cruiser. &#x201c;What the hell are you doing, Hannah?&#x201d; she demanded, and rattled the mesh, hard. &#x201c;Where are you taking Michael?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s safe,&#x201d; Hannah said. &#x201c;Nothing will happen to him. Trust me, Eve.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, you know what? Bite me. I don&#x2019;t trust you. You just stabbed us all in the back, you horrible bi&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>Claire grabbed Eve and dragged her away, changing the word to a protesting yelp. &#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; she whispered fiercely in her best friend&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to accomplish anything by making her angry at us. Just wait. Be quiet and wait.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Easy for you to say,&#x201d; Eve hissed. &#x201c;Shane&#x2019;s coming with us at least. Michael&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t even know where they&#x2019;re taking him!&#x201d; </p><p>She had a point. Claire really hated to admit it, but there was absolutely nothing they could accomplish locked in a police cruiser. And antagonizing the lady who held the keys to their handcuffs probably wasn&#x2019;t the best strategy. </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not giving up,&#x201d; she told Eve. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just . . . biding our time.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And what do you think they&#x2019;re going to do to him while we&#x2019;re biding, exactly?&#x201d; Eve asked, yanking at the mesh again. &#x201c;Yo, Han�nah! How does it feel to stab your friends in the back? Hope you didn&#x2019;t get blood all over your neatly pressed uniform!&#x201d; </p><p>The deputy turned around and gave her a cold, hard stare. &#x201c;Sit quietly,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll shock you until you do.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;With what, your breath? Ever heard of flossing, Deputy Dimwit?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Eve,&#x201d; Hannah said. It was a warning, a flat and naked one, and it was reinforced by the deputy&#x2014;whose breath, in all fairness, did kind of reek&#x2014;taking out a Taser. </p><p>Although Eve was still simmering with rage, she let go and sat back, folding her arms over her chest. Then she kicked his seat.

In these memoirs he retraces his bohemian student years in Santiago; his sojourns as Chilean consul in Burma, Ceylon, and Java, in Spain during the civil war, and in Mexico; and his service as a Chilean senator. Neruda, a Communist, was driven from his senate seat in 1948, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. After a year in hiding, he escaped on horseback over the Andes and then to Europe; his travels took him to Russia, Eastern Europe, and China before he was finally able to return home in 1952. The final section of the memoirs was written after the coup in 1972 that overthrew Neruda's friend Salvador Allende. </p><p>Many of the century's most important literary and artistic figures were Neruda's friends, and figure in his memoirs--Garcia Lorca, Aragon, Picasso, and Rivera, among them--and also such political leaders as Gandhi, Nehru, Mao, Castro, and Che Guevara.

Here, Teresa of Avila, the great Spanish mystic and theological Doctor of the Church, meticulously (and metaphorically, using striking marriage and nature imagery) details the theological doctrine of transformative union with the incarnate, Triune God that systematically evolved over the course of her lifetime of spiritual experiences and scriptural knowledge. In seven sections of this companion, paralleling those of &#34;Interior Castle, Gillian Ahlgren clearly and methodically explicates each passage of the soul, which is envisioned as a crystal castle made of many rooms-from stillness and contemplative prayer, to humbling self-knowledge, to understanding of the potentiality of the human-divine union, and to the center of the seventh, the place of transformative union, and the deeper, theological insights into God.</p><p>Gillian T.W.

Weber Series in the New Borderlands History)</h2><p>In this book, Mireya Loza sheds new light on the private lives of migrant men who participated in the Bracero Program (1942&#x2013;1964), a binational agreement between the United States and Mexico that allowed hundreds of thousands of Mexican workers to enter this country on temporary work permits. While this program and the issue of temporary workers has long been politicized on both sides of the border, Loza argues that the prevailing romanticized image of braceros as a family-oriented, productive, legal workforce has obscured the real, diverse experiences of the workers themselves. Focusing on underexplored aspects of workers' lives--such as their transnational union-organizing efforts, the sexual economies of both hetero and queer workers, and the ethno-racial boundaries among Mexican indigenous braceros--Loza reveals how these men defied perceived political, sexual, and racial norms.<br><br>Basing her work on an archive of more than 800 oral histories from the United States and Mexico, Loza is the first scholar to carefully differentiate between the experiences of mestizo guest workers and the many Mixtec, Zapotec, Purhepecha, and Mayan laborers. In doing so, she captures the myriad ways these defiant workers responded to the intense discrimination and exploitation of an unjust system that still persists today.<br><br></p><p>Mireya Loza is a curator in the Division of Political History at the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution.An essential purchase for any serious collection on labor, social, and migration history, and should be included within any course or curriculum related to gender studies, human rights, oral testimonies, public history, or Latino/a studies.--<i>American Historical Review</i><br>An exceptional addition to the historical literature on braceros. . . .

Vibrant, shocking, nonstop, and revealing, <i>The Last Party</i> is as packed with sparkle, scandal, and celebrity as Studio 54 itself.</p></p><p>British socialite and writer Anthony Haden-Guest has been a champion party-goer for more than 30 years. There are few people more qualified to lead a reader, as he does in <i>The Last Party,</i> past the velvet ropes and doorman and into the tornado of 1970s disco, drug excess, and excessive sex that was Studio 54. Unlike some of his contemporaries whose memories are dulled by years of hard living, Haden-Guest seems to actually recall many of his experiences at Studio. His book is therefore part personal memoir, part reportage. <p> The cast of characters includes Andy, Liza, Halston, and Bianca--no last names needed--and other luminaries etched into Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager's exclusive guest list. The anecdotes include lurid details of the revelry and stories like the one about that Halloween when two Lady Godivas were kept outside but their horse was allowed in. Haden-Guest resists the obvious urge to dish too much about the stars and instead examines the club as a social phenomenon. In his book, the front door of Studio 54 swings open just long enough to let escape the shadow of a scene that's long since seen the light of day.</p>Studio 54 was the icon of excesses. It was the cradle of today's culture of celebrity, a place were Liza, Mick, and Andy lounged in the VIP section while revelers did drugs in the fabled unisex bathroom, and would-be revelers waited hour after hour on West Fifty-fourth Street, hoping to catch the eye of a nineteen-year-old-doorman who was, for a brief moment, the ultimate gatekeeper of cool. <p>The Last Party is the story not just of Studio 54 but of the whole Nightworld. Anthony Haden-Guest was on this scene at the opening night party and many nights thereafter. He knew all the key players and has interviewed everyone, from the stars and club kids who made the scene to the impresarios who created it to the cops who ultimately brought it down. He takes us past the velvet cord, down onto the pounding dance floor, up into the polymorphously perverse balcony, and on into Steve Rubell's office, where a few insiders stuffed cash into garbage bags as they skimmed millions from their golden goose. He shows us the after-hours clubs, the seamy underbelly of New York nightlife, and the ever-more-violent aftermath of the world that Studio 54 launched with such flash. Vivid, nonstop, and revealing, The Last Party is as packed with sparkle, scandal, and celebrity as Studio itself.</p></p><h2>Fatima: The Apparition That Changed the World</h2><p>Fatima. Few place-names in the Christian world conjure up such powerful images and associations as that of this humble town in Portugal. For it was there that Our Lady appeared to three shepherd children beginning in 1917&#x2014;apparitions that are intimately linked to pious Catholic practices such as devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the five first Saturdays, daily recitation of the Rosary with the Fatima prayer, as well as miracles attested to even by non-believers, such as the &#x201c;day the sun danced.&#x201d; The Virgin&#x2019;s message, as it always is, was penance. But she also predicted world historical events such as the rise and fall of communism, the second world war, and the attempted assassination of Pope St. John Paul II. She promised refuge in her Immaculate Heart to all who approach her&#x2014;a promise extended, and urgently needed, today.<br><br> This beautifully illustrated volume will be treasured by long-time devotees of our Blessed Mother under the title of Our Lady of Fatima, as well as those, both Catholic and non-Catholic alike, who seek to learn more about the dramatic events related to the apparition that have unfolded over the course of the last century.<br><br> In Fatima: The Apparition That Changed the World, noted Catholic author and Blue Army member Jean M.

By looking disaster squarely in the face, by understanding just how badly things could spiral out of control, they sought to create a communal sense of responsibility and courage&#x2014;to spur citizens and their leaders to take the difficult actions necessary to avert such a fate. Today, after more than seventy years of great-power peace and a quarter-century of unrivaled global leadership, Americans have lost their sense of tragedy. They have forgotten that the descent into violence and war has been all too common throughout human history. This amnesia has become most pronounced just as Americans and the global order they created are coming under graver threat than at any time in decades.<br><br> In a forceful argument that brims with historical sensibility and policy insights, two distinguished historians argue that a tragic sensibility is necessary if America and its allies are to address the dangers that menace the international order today. Tragedy may be commonplace, Brands and Edel argue, but it is not inevitable&#x2014;so long as we regain an appreciation of the world&#x2019;s tragic nature before it is too late.</p><p>In this timely new book, two distinguished historians remind us that American prosperity and security were built by leaders with a tragic understanding of the past. Brands and Edel argue that recovering a tragic sensibility&#x2014;an understanding that the descent into violence and war has been all too common throughout human history&#x2014;is necessary to address the dangers that stalk the international order today.<b>Hal Brands</b> is the Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor of Global Affairs in the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. <b>Charles Edel</b> is a senior fellow at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney and previously served on the U.S. Secretary of State&#x2019;s policy planning staff.</p><h2>The Boyfriend</h2><p>Jack Till, who has retired from the LAPD after a respected career as a homicide detective, now works as a private investigator, comfortable chasing down routine cases while visiting his 24-year-old daughter, Holly, who has Down Syndrome. But when the parents of a recently murdered young girl, about Holly's age, ask for his help when the police come up empty, Till reluctantly takes the case.<br><br>It was discovered after her death that the victim had been working as a high-class prostitute, and the police are content to assume she was killed by a client, common in such a dangerous line of work. Yet as Till digs deeper, he realizes that the victim is just one of several young female escorts killed in different cities in the exact same way &#x2013; all had strawberry blonde hair, and all were shot with a 9mm handgun in the sanctity of their apartments.<br><br>Till must find his way around the tawdry and secretive online escort business, and decode ads placed by young women who all use false names, sometimes advertise using other women's pictures, and move from city to city every few months. Yet when Till is finally able to catch up with the killer, he finds that the man he's after is far more dangerous and volatile than he ever could have imagined. As the body count rises, Till must risk his life to find this seductive and ruthless killer whose murderous spree masks a far deadlier agenda.<br><br></p><p><b>Thomas Perry</b>, noted for his sophisticated and humorous suspense novels, has written 21 novels, many national bestsellers, including <i>The Butcher&#x2019;s Boy</i>, which won the Best First Novel Edgar award, and the celebrated Jane Whitefield series.<br>Clever protagonists, cunning killers, white-knuckle action . . .

Although most of these accounts appeared before the Civil War, more than one-third are the result of the ambitious efforts of the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to interview surviving ex-slaves during the 1930s. The result of these efforts was the Slave Narrative Collection&#x2015;a group of autobiographical accounts of former slaves that today stands as one of the most enduring and noteworthy achievements of the WPA. Compiled in seventeen states during the years 1936-38, the collection consists of more than two thousand interviews with former slaves, most of them first-person accounts of slave life and the respondents' own reactions to bondage. The interviews afforded aged ex-slaves an unparalleled opportunity to give their personal accounts of life under the "peculiar institution," to describe in their own words what it felt like to be a slave in the United States.<br>&#x2015;Norman R.

It is probably the finest book on the subject of drawing the human form that I have ever seen." &#x2014; Irving Shapiro, A.W.S., Director, American Academy of Art<br>This unique guide offers a bold, innovative approach to drawing from life. Instead of teaching the traditional method of building up a drawing from lines, leaving mass and tone till later, noted art instructor Douglas R. Graves takes precisely the opposite tack. The student is encouraged to begin seeing and thinking in terms of tonal masses immediately. This approach enables students to draw quickly and accurately without the need for a line drawing first. The author compares it to learning to "paint" with charcoal.<br>Step-by-step demonstrations and over 200 of the author's own drawings offer inspiration and practical guidance in the technique. You'll learn how to "see" tonal quality, how to key a drawing, how to translate color into black and white, and valuable techniques for keeping the figure from looking "stiff."

Ancient urban dwellings were inward-looking, ranged around a courtyard. Until fairly recently, these dwelling types survived in indigenous urban house forms in the Islamic world, India, China, and the Iberian peninsula and Latin America. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, however, outward-looking house forms replaced the ancient form in most of Europe and the New World.<br><br> In the Middle Ages houses served both as homes and as places of work, but gradually the domestic and business lives of the inhabitants became separate. In the wake of the Industrial Revolution, profound changes in the residential development of the western world occurred: housing became segregated along socioeconomic lines and dwelling types polarized, with low-density, single-family houses at one extreme, and tall, high-density, multifamily tenements and apartments at the other. Side effects of America&#x2019;s automobile-intensive suburban dream housing include inefficient land use, pollution, and urban decay. <em>6,000 Years of Housing</em> chronicles how this came about, and suggests solutions based on a rich variety of historical precedents.</p><p>Norbert Schoenauer is Macdonald Emeritus Professor of Architecture at McGill University.

As diverse as those characters are, they don&#39;t begin to reveal the full scope of talent demonstrated by one of Hollywood&#39;s most intelligent leading men. Elegant, witty and dignified, Powell created accessible and human characters in a great variety of roles. His talent was such that Powell has a large and growing fan base 50 years after his last film was released, evidenced by the popularity of DVD rereleases and the frequent appearance of his films on cable television. The focus of this book is Powell&#39;s work in more than 90 films, from the silent era to the age of CinemaScope, woven into the dramatic and touching story of the actor&#39;s life. It begins by leaping into how Powell and actress Myrna Loy were launched to stardom as husband and wife Nick and Nora Charles in The Thin Man. The next chapter sets the stage for the baby Powell&#39;s entry into the world in 1892 and details his childhood and upbringing. Following chapters trace Powell&#39;s journey into the film industry, his early career as a popular villain, and his transition to talkies in the late 1920s aided by his stage training. The book details his work at Warner Bros., which turned him into a leading man, and his years of stardom at MGM. The book describes turning points in Powell&#39;s life--the death of lover Jean Harlow, a 21-month hiatus from films while the actor battled cancer, and a new leap to the top in Life with Father. Concluding chapters detail another flurry of films and the actor&#39;s retirement. A filmography lists Powell&#39;s films from 1922 to 1955, including those believed to be lost.</p><p>Roger Bryant lives in Midland, Michigan, where he is a freelance writer and business intelligence analyst.&#34;Valuable.&#34; --Mystery Scene</p><h2>US Navy Aircraft Carriers, 1942-45: WWII-Built Ships (New Vanguard)</h2><p><p>Dominating the seas during World War II, the US aircraft carrier played a crucial role in every major naval combat of the war. </p><p>Development of the Essex class began in 1941, and was the largest class of carrier ever built. During the Pacific War it formed the backbone of any fighting force and became renowned for its mighty 'Sunday Punch' - the impressive offensive power of 36 fighter planes, 36 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo planes.</p><p>The Independence class was a lighter and faster carrier, built after Pearl Harbor, to bring more ships into action as quickly as possible. Alongside the Essex class their crews saw a dramatic change in tactical deployment as they began to form the fast carrier task forces that were so effective in Pacific operations.</p><p>Featuring an annotated cutaway and artwork detailing both the interior and exterior features of the ships, this book explores the design, development, and deployment of both the Essex and Independence class of light carriers. This sequel to US Navy Aircraft Carriers 1922-45: Prewar classes (New Vanguard 114), provides a detailed exploration of the carriers that were at the forefront of many actions in World War II, including the climatic battles of Phillipine Sea and Leyte Gulf in 1944.</p></p><p>Commander (retired) Mark O Stille served as a career Naval Intelligence Officer , spending over five years of his naval career assigned to various US Navy carriers.

Issues of water scarcity and pollution, the loss of farmland, and the degradation of sacred land are especially contentious. She traces the emergence of the conflicts by discussing the smelter-town of La Oroya&#x2014;where people have lived with toxic emissions for almost a century&#x2014;before focusing her analysis on the relatively new Yanacocha gold mega-mine. Debates about what kinds of knowledge count as legitimate, Li argues, lie at the core of activist and corporate mining campaigns. Li pushes against the concept of "equivalence"&#x2014;or methods with which to quantify and compare things such as pollution&#x2014;to explain how opposing groups interpret environmental regulations, assess a project&#x2019;s potential impacts, and negotiate monetary compensation for damages. This politics of equivalence is central to these mining controversies, and Li uncovers the mechanisms through which competing parties create knowledge, assign value, arrive at contrasting definitions of pollution, and construct the Peruvian mountains as spaces under constant negotiation.<br></p><p>Fabiana Li is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Manitoba."<i>Unearthing Conflict</i> is a well-documented, thoughtful, and engagingly written account of mining-related conflicts in Peru. Looking at two different historically situated modes of resource extraction through the lens of ontological politics and 'contested equivalence,' Fabiana Li provides a novel, conceptually productive view of how such things as 'pollution' and 'water as life' are constituted and behave as actors in the world.

Speakers from across generations shared poems that showcased the aesthetic of the written word and aimed to spread interest in reading and writing in O&#x2019;odham.<br><br> The poems capture brief moments of beauty, the loving bond between family members, and a deep appreciation of Tohono O&#x2019;odham culture and traditions, as well as reverent feelings about the landscape and wildlife native to the Southwest. A motif of rain and water is woven throughout the poetry in <i>When It Rains,</i> tying in the collection&#x2019;s title to the importance of this life-giving and sustaining resource to the Tohono O&#x2019;odham people. With the poems in both O&#x2019;odham and English, the volume serves as an important reminder of the beauty and changeability of the O&#x2019;odham language.<br><br> The themes and experiences expressed by the language educators in this volume capture still-rural community life: children are still bussed for miles to school, and parents still have hours-long daily commutes to work.

He offers here a book of focus and skill that will be a great help on your path."&#x2015;Deborah Lipp, author of <em>The Elements of Ritual</em> and <em>The Study of Witchcraft</em></p> <p>"What a pleasure and most certainly a privilege it was to keep company with and listen to Christopher Penczak's lessons/workshop/ lectures; his humour is marvellously universal; and better still, funny. I was impressed and the opinion that the good teachers of the Craft have always been at their best when young was once again confirmed. Christopher is a vibrant man with vast knowledge and understanding of the mysteries. He has none of the pomposity which is so apparent in many public Craft speakers."&#x2015;Maxine Sanders, Author of <em>Fire Child</em> and Alexandrian Elder</p> <p>"It is a joy for me to share these comments. I began my training for Initiation when Christopher was not yet two years old. As one of the elder Wiccans around, I have seen a profusion of books being written about Wicca yet only a few authors begin to grasp the depth and wonder of Wicca as a valid Mystery Tradition. Reading Christopher's books and coming to know him as a fellow author and educator, he is, in my opinion, the finest of the new generation of Wiccan educators and authors. Beginning with <em>The Inner Temple of Witchcraft</em> and <em>The Outer Temple of Witchcraft</em>, among his other books, Christopher has prepared the student for this major working of self-discovery and wisdom. In this new two-volume series, he offers the serious student a well-crafted and intelligent path into the Mysteries of Witchcraft. Readers can place themselves safely into Christopher's care, reading this thoughtful, well-constructed text and working with the projects and meditations which allow for guided study. Few books have ever been written capable of guiding a solitary practitioner into the inner mysteries. He takes the student through the initiatory concepts and practices of the seven archetypes which have been known to many generations of wise people in many cultures which, if this work is embraced, will bring the reader into the joys of spiritual wisdom."&#x2015;Rev. Paul Beyerl, Author of <em>The Master Book of Herbalism</em>, <em>The Holy Books of the Devas</em> and founder of The Rowan Tree Church</p> <p>"Christopher Penczak has assembled a comprehensive summary of initiatory and magical techniques from many ancient traditions in this valuable resource book. But he has done more, for he shows the reader, with clarity and precision, how such traditions and textual sources have a thread of spiritual and transformative connection with one another, and how they may be used in new ways in a modern practice of witchcraft and magic. He also allows the student to make conscious choices, rather than dictate any one dogmatic path or tradition, offering multiple ways in which the inner calling to witchcraft can be brought through into the waking mind. In the 21st century, revival witchcraft and paganism emerges into a new phase of maturity, and readers are fortunate to have a new generation of writers whose work comes from dedicated practice and experience rather than from sensationalism and posturing. Christopher's book combines research, integrity, and experience, and gives the student substantial material to explore and practice."&#x2015;R. J. Stewart, musican, composer, and author of more than 40 books including <em>The Living World of Faery</em> and <em>Advanced Magical Arts</em></p> <p>"Christopher Penczak is a gentle priest with lightning bolts at his fingertips.

Thorn Coyle, author of <em>Evolutionary Witchcraft</em> <em>and Kissing the Limitless</em></p> <p>"A well-written, inspired and in-depth course on witchcraft and associated magical traditions; this comprehensive guidebook is a priceless treasure for the true seeker focused on the balanced and integrated development of self as a spiritual, magical and ethical being.

Though the romance is appropriately sweet, it's Darcy's family dynamics-the war waging within her between love and resentment, the desperation to cling to loyalty while running toward independence-that sets the book apart.

But despite their prominence, the Etruscans are often portrayed as mysterious&#x2014;a strange and unknowable people whose language and culture have largely vanished. Lucy Shipley&#x2019;s <i>The Etruscans</i> presents a different picture.<br><br> Shipley writes of a people who traded with Greece and shaped the development of Rome, who inspired Renaissance artists and Romantic firebrands, and whose influence is still felt strongly in the modern world. Covering colonialism and conquest, misogyny and mystique, she weaves Etruscan history with new archaeological evidence to give us a revived picture of the Etruscan people. The book traces trade routes and trains of thought, describing the journey of Etruscan objects from creation to use, loss, rediscovery, and reinvention. From the wrappings of an Egyptian mummy displayed in a fashionable salon to the extra-curricular activities of Bonaparte, from a mass looting craze to a bombed museum in a town marked by massacre, the book is an extraordinary voyage through Etruscan archaeology, which ultimately leads to surprising and intriguing places.<br><br> In this sharp and groundbreaking book, Shipley gives readers a unique perspective on an enigmatic people, revealing just how much we know about the Etruscans&#x2014;and just how much still remains undiscovered.</p><p><b>Lucy Shipley</b> is a writer and blogger. She received her PhD in Etruscan archaeology from the University of Southampton in 2014."<i>The Etruscans</i> is cleverly written, because each chapter deals with one problem and then takes one object or place as an example of that problem. . . . This is a splendid little book, which brings the Etruscans up to date and does much to strip away the mystery that surrounds this lost civilization." (<i>Current World Archaeology</i>)<br><br>"Shipley sets her course by identifying a select object or place as a focus for each chapter. . . . These prompt an examination of different aspects of the Etruscan world. It is a neat device enabling the author to guide us through what has actually been discovered, what the objects may say about the Etruscans, and to make robust examinations of a range of theories about them that have been put forward over time. . . . Shipley&#x2019;s book is as engaging as her subject. Her work leaves us eager to discover more about this most fascinating group of people." (<i>Minerva</i>)<br><br>"Shipley&#x2019;s [bridges] deftly the ancient evidence and modern debates, and [shifts] focus seamlessly from the big picture to captivating details. She writes in an engaging, breezy style . . . Shipley&#x2019;s book accomplishes its mission with aplomb: it will not only hold the interest of students and scholars alike, but also speak in powerful ways to the interested lay reader. Indeed, if there is one book among the recent spate of works on the Etruscans that is likely to win over the popular imagination&#x2014;one as alive to their distinct character and accomplishments as their lost legacy and muddled afterlives&#x2014;Shipley&#x2019;s book is surely it. For <i>The Etruscans </i>demonstrates that new facts can be more interesting than old fiction." (<i>Classical Journal</i>)<br><br>"Balanced and fully informed. . . . Excellent." (Fred S. Kleiner <i>Historian</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Shipley&#x2019;s concise and elegant prose serves as an ideal complement to her fascinating subject. The people of this remarkable and enigmatic culture come alive in a brilliant treatment appropriate for any audience.&#x201d; (Anthony Tuck, University of Massachusetts Amherst and director of the Poggio Civitate Excavations)</p><h2>Jazz Theory Resources: Volume 2</h2><p>(Jazz Book).

Yeats Volume XIII: A Vision: The Original 1925 Version</h2><p>The Collected Works of W. B. Yeats, Volume XIII: A Vision is part of a fourteen-volume series under the general editorship of eminent Yeats scholar George Bornstein and formerly the late Richard J. Finneran and George Mills Harper. One of the strangest works of literary modernism, A Vision is Yeats&#39;s greatest occult work. Edited by Yeats scholars Catherine E. Paul and Margaret Mills Harper, the volume presents the &#34;system&#34; of philosophy, psychology, history, and the life of the soul that Yeats and his wife George (ne Hyde Lees) received and created by means of mediumistic experiments from 1917 through the early 1920s. Yeats obsessively revised the book, and the revised 1937 version is much more widely available than its predecessor. The original 1925 version of A Vision, poetic, unpolished, masked in fiction, and close to the excitement of the automatic writing that the Yeatses believed to be its supernatural origin, is presented here in a scholarly edition for the first time. The text, minimally corrected to retain the sense of the original, is extensively annotated, with particular attention paid to the relationship between the published book and its complex genetic materials. Indispensable to an understanding of the poet&#39;s late work and entrancing on its own merit, A Vision aims to be, all at once, a work of theoretical history, an esoteric philosophy, an aesthetic symbology, a psychological schema, and a sacred book. It is as difficult as it is essential reading for any student of Yeats.</p><p>William Butler Yeats is generally considered to be Ireland&#x2019;s greatest poet, living or dead, and one of the most important literary figures of the twentieth century.

Perhaps this book has been written because a number of young men and women, you and I among the number, met nearly forty years ago in London and in Paris to discuss mystical philosophy. You with your beauty and your learning and your mysterious gifts were held by all in affection, and though, when the first draft of this dedication was written, I had not seen you for more than thirty years, nor knew where you were nor what you were doing, and though much had happened since we copied the Jewish Schemahamphorasch with its seventy-two Names of God in Hebrew characters, it was plain that I must dedicate my book to you. All other students who were once friends or friends' friends were dead or estranged. Florence Farr coming to her fiftieth year, dreading old age and fading beauty, had made a decision we all dreamt of at one time or another, and accepted a position as English teacher in a native school in Ceylon that she might study oriental thought, and had died there. Another had become a Buddhist monk, and some ten years ago a traveller of my acquaintance found him in a Burmese monastery. A third lived through that strange adventure, perhaps the strangest of all adventures -- Platonic love. When he was a child his nurse said to him -- 'An Angel bent over your bed last night', and in his seventeenth year he awoke to see the phantom of a beautiful woman at his bedside. Presently he gave himself up to all kinds of amorous adventures, until at last, in I think his fiftieth year but when he had still all his physical vigour, he thought 'I do not need women but God.' Then he and a very good, charming, young fellow-student fell in love with one another and though he could only keep down his passion with the most bitter struggle, they lived together platonically, and this they did, not from prejudice, for I think they had none, but from a clear sense of something to be attained by what seemed a most needless trampling of the grapes of life. She died, and he survived her but a little time during which he saw her in apparition and attained through her certain of the traditional experiences of the saint. He was my close friend, and had he lived I would have asked him to accept the dedication of a book I could not expect him to approve, for in his later life he cared for little but what seemed to him a very simple piety. We all, so far as I can remember, differed from ordinary students of philosophy or religion through our belief that truth cannot be discovered but may be revealed, and that if a man do not lose faith, and if he go through certain preparations, revelation will find him at the fitting moment. I remember a learned brassfounder in the North of England who visited us occasionally, and was convinced that there was a certain moment in every year which, once known, brought with it 'The Summum Bonum, the Stone of the Wise'. But others, for it was clear that there must be a vehicle or symbol of communication, were of opinion that some messenger would make himself known, in a railway train let us say, or might be found after search in some distant land. I look back to it as a time when we were full of a phantasy that has been handed down for generations, and is now an interpretation, now an enlargement of the folk-lore of the villages. That phantasy did not explain the world to our intellects which were after all very modern, but it recalled certain forgotten methods of meditation and chiefly how so to suspend the will that the mind became automatic, a possible vehicle for spiritual beings. It carried us to what we had learned to call Hodos Chameliontos.</p><p></p>II<p>Some were looking for spiritual happiness or for some form of unknown power, but I had a practical object. I wished for a system of thought that would leave my imagination free to create as it chose and yet make all that it created, or could create, part of the one history, and that the soul's. The Greeks certainly had such a system, and Dante -- though Boccaccio thought him a bitter partisan and therefore a modern abstract man -- and I think no man since. Then when I had ceased all active search, yet had not ceased from desire, the documents upon which this book is founded were put into my hands, and I had what I needed, though it may be too late. What I have found indeed is nothing new, for I will show presently that Swedenborg and Blake and many before them knew that all things had their gyres; but Swedenborg and Blake preferred to explain them figuratively, and so I am the first to substitute for Biblical or mythological figures, historical movements and actual men and women.</p><p></p>III<p>I have moments of exaltation like that in which I wrote 'All Souls' Night', but I have other moments when remembering my ignorance of philosophy I doubt if I can make another share my excitement. As I most fear to disappoint those that come to this book through some interest in my poetry and in that alone, I warn them from that part of the book called 'The Great Wheel' and from the whole of Book II, and beg them to dip here and there in the verse and into my comments upon life and history. Upon the other hand my old fellow students may confine themselves to what is most technical and explanatory; thought is nothing without action, but if they will master what is most abstract there and make it the foundation of their visions, the curtain may ring up on a new drama.</p><p>I could I daresay make the book richer, perhaps immeasurably so, if I were to keep it by me for another year, and I have not even dealt with the whole of my subject, perhaps not even with what is most important, writing nothing about the Beatific Vision, little of sexual love; but I am longing to put it out of reach that I may write the poetry it seems to have made possible. I can now, if I have the energy, find the simplicity I have sought in vain. I need no longer write poems like 'The Phases of the Moon' nor 'Ego Dominus Tuus', nor spend barren years, as I have done some three or four times, striving with abstractions that substituted themselves for the play that I had planned.</p><p></p>IV<p>Doubtless I must someday complete what I have begun, but for the moment my imagination dwells upon a copy of Powys Mather's <i>Arabian Nights</i> that awaits my return home. I would forget the wisdom of the East and remember its grossness and its romance. Yet when I wander upon the cliffs where Augustus and Tiberius wandered, I know that the new intensity that seems to have come into all visible and tangible things is not a reaction from that wisdom but its very self. Yesterday when I saw the dry and leafless vineyards at the very edge of the motionless sea, or lifting their brown stems from almost inaccessible patches of earth high up on the cliff-side, or met at the turn of the path the orange and lemon trees in full fruit, or the crimson cactus flower, or felt the warm sunlight falling between blue and blue, I murmured, as I have countless times, 'I have been part of it always and there is maybe no escape, forgetting and returning life after life like an insect in the roots of the grass.' But murmured it without terror, in exultation almost.</p><p>W.B.Y.</p><p>Capri, February, 1925</p><p>Copyright � 1925 by William Butler Yeats</p></p><h2>A New Religious America: How a &#34;Christian Country&#34; Has Become the World&#39;s Most Religiously Diverse Nation</h2><p><p>Why Understanding America's Religious Landscape Is the Most Important Challenge Facing Us Today</p> <ul><li>The 1990s saw the U.S. Navy commission its first Muslim chaplain and open its first mosque.</li><li>There are presently more than three hundred temples in Los Angeles, home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world.</li><li>There are more American Muslims than there are American Episcopalians, Jews, or Presbyterians.</li></ul></p><p><p>Diana L. Eck is Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University and is Master of Lowell House and Director of The Pluralism Project. As a Christian, she has also been involved in the United Methodist Church, the World Council of Churches, and the life of Harvard Divinity School. Her book Encountering God: A Spiritual Journey from Bozeman to Banaras won the prestigious Grawemeyer Book Award. In 1998, President Clinton awarded her the National Humanities Medal for the work of The Pluralism Project in the investigation of America's religious diversity.</p>Eck, professor of comparative religion at Harvard University, delivers a stunning tour de force that may forever change the way Americans claim to be "one nation, under God." Drawing on her work with the Pluralism Project, an ongoing study of religious diversity in the United States, Eck focuses here on the explosion of Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist communities in America, particularly since 1965. How has the growth of these religions changed the American landscape? And just as important, how are the religions themselves changing because of America? Eck's travels take her (and us) to major cities, but also to places such as Greenville, S.C.; Portland, Maine; and Toledo, Ohio. Eck is a highly skilled ethnographer who delicately balances the challenge of interpreting events while also participating in them. The success of this portrait lies in the details: in the Nikes and Reeboks that adorn the shoe racks in Sikh gurdwaras, Islamic mosques and Hindu temples; in the Muslim Girl Scout who promises to "serve Allah and my country"; in the consecration rituals at a Massachusetts Hindu temple, where the waters of India's sacred Ganges River are mixed with the Mississippi and poured freely over the building. Eck does far more than simply document the presence of religious diversity in America; she places it in historical context and illustrates the ongoing challenges it presents by describing legal battles and pivotal court cases. The last chapters address the rise of religiously motivated hate crimes and, conversely, the innovative ways some communities have welcomed religious pluralism.

If Blackness is not biological in origin but socially and discursively constructed, does the meaning of Blackness change over time and space? In <i>Physics of Blackness: Beyond the Middle Passage Epistemology</i>, Michelle M. Wright argues that although we often explicitly define Blackness as a &#x201c;what,&#x201d; it in fact always operates as a &#x201c;when&#x201d; and a &#x201c;where.&#x201d; </p><p>By putting lay discourses on spacetime from physics into conversation with works on identity from the African Diaspora, <i>Physics of Blackness</i> explores how Middle Passage epistemology subverts racist assumptions about Blackness, yet its linear structure inhibits the kind of inclusive epistemology of Blackness needed in the twenty-first century. Wright then engages with bodies frequently excluded from contemporary mainstream consideration: Black feminists, Black queers, recent Black African immigrants to the West, and Blacks whose histories may weave in and out of the Middle Passage epistemology but do not cohere to it. </p><p>Physics of Blackness takes the reader on a journey both known and unfamiliar&#x2014;from Isaac Newton&#x2019;s laws of motion and gravity to the contemporary politics of diasporic Blackness in the academy, from James Baldwin&#x2019;s postwar trope of the Eiffel Tower as the site for diasporic encounters to theoretical particle physics&#x2019; theory of multiverses and superpositioning, to the almost erased lives of Black African women during World War II.

Its redeployment of analytical categories informs an innovative, interdisciplinary approach that necessarily reinvigorates and enhances generally academic and societally transformative pursuits for future oriented, inclusive and nonhierarchical understandings of not just black, but all,racial(ised) ontologies."&#x2014;<i>Transnational Literature</i></p></p><h2>The Rhythm Boys of Omaha Central: High School Basketball at the &#39;68 Racial Divide</h2><p>In the spring of 1968, the Omaha Central High School basketball team made history with its first all-black starting lineup.

When we encounter an attractive piece of jewelry, our instinct is to admire the front, but when we turn it around, it often reveals a secret. The author lets us in on that secret, typically only shared between the maker and the wearer. Clever brooch makers often adorn the back with items meant to complement the front, or the backside may have a unique, intricate design all its own. When you flip a brooch over in your hand you may find a surprise message, a hidden pattern, or even an unlikely foreign implement. The result is a better understanding of the artist&#39;s abilities and personality. Now, you can judge for yourself what the 128 artists respresented in this volume had in mind, and, if you are a jewelry maker, you may be inspired to leave your own unique mark.</p><p>Lorena Angulo grew up in Mexico.

Biblical and practical, this book gets down to the real questions in the disciple making process:<br> How can I avoid discredited authoritarian models for disciple-making?<p> What is the biblical case for making disciples?</p><p> How can I disciple others if I was never discipled?</p><p> How do I select someone to disciple?</p><p> How do I get started?</p><p> How do I become the kind of close friend that can influence another?</p><p> What sort of goals should we set?</p><p> What kind of study content is most helpful?</p><p> How can I foster a love of prayer in another?</p><p> Why do people follow some models more than others?</p><p> How can I create a life-long thirst for doing ministry?</p><p> How can I effectively coach my friend in his or her ministry?</p><p> When and how do I release a disciple to independence?</p><p> These authors are experts who have raised up hundreds of house church leaders and other Christian workers during their combined 60 years of experience.</p><p></p></p><p>This is currently the most comprehensive guide to spiritual parenting (discipleship) in print today. The church in which the authors serve is Xenos Christian Fellowship in Columbus, Ohio. The process revealed in this book has helped Xenos to bring 80% of their church members into a discipling relationship with another person. Simply amazing!How did the early church raise up leaders and servants when they had no seminaries or training schools? Why were they so vital that they grew in a way never seen since the first century? Maybe we should take a look at the ancient method of mentoring that built quality into people's lives, instead of warehousing numbers who passively absorb what the professionals dish up?<p> This is not a curriculum for making disciples.</p><p> Forget about formulas for making disciples.</p><p> Avoid high-control, "shepherding" theories of discipleship.</p><p> This is an approach that grows the organic way: out of love relationships and real community.</p><p> Jesus didn't only tell us to go and make converts. He told us to go and make disciples! Maybe if the modern church focused more on building into the lives of its people we would see the kind of dynamic fellowship described in the New Testament.</p></p><h2>Captain Beefheart&#39;s Trout Mask Replica (33 1/3)</h2><p><p>In the spring of 1969, the inauspicious release of Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band's <i>Trout Mask Replica</i>, a double-album featuring 28 stream-of-consciousness songs filled with abstract rhythms and guttural bellows, dramatically altered the pop landscape.</p><br><p>Yet even if the album did cast its radical vision over the future of music, much of the record's artistic strength is actually drawn from the past. This book examines how Beefheart's incomparable opus, an album that divided (rather than) united a pop audience, is informed by a variety of diverse sources. <i>Trout Mask Replica</i> is a hybrid of poetic declarations inspired by both Walt Whitman and the beat poets, the field hollers of the Delta Blues, the urban blues of Howlin' Wolf, the gospel blues of Blind Willie Johnson, and the free jazz of Ornette Coleman. This book illustrates how <i>Trout Mask Replica </i>was not so much an arcane specimen of the avant-garde, but rather a defiantly original declaration of the American imagination.</p></p><p><p>Kevin Courrier is the author of several books, including Dangerous Kitchen: The Subversive World of Zappa, and Randy Newman's American Dreams.

Thornton examines the concept of place in the language, social structure, economy, and ritual of southeast Alaska's Tlingit Indians. Place signifies not only a specific geographical location but also reveals the ways in which individuals and social groups define themselves.<br><br>The notion of place consists of three dimensions - space, time, and experience - which are culturally and environmentally structured. Thornton examines each in detail to show how individual and collective Tlingit notions of place, being, and identity are formed. As he observes, despite cultural and environmental changes over time, particularly in the post-contact era since the late eighteenth century, Tlingits continue to bind themselves and their culture to places and landscapes in distinctive ways. He offers insight into how Tlingits in particular, and humans in general, conceptualize their relationship to the lands they inhabit, arguing for a study of place that considers all aspects of human interaction with landscape.<br><br>In Tlingit, it is difficult even to introduce oneself without referencing places in Lingit Aani (Tlingit Country). Geographic references are embedded in personal names, clan names, house names, and, most obviously, in k-waan names, which define regions of dwelling. To say one is Sheet'ka K-waan defines one as a member of the Tlingit community that inhabits Sheet'ka (Sitka).<br><br><i>Being and Place</i> among the Tlingit makes a substantive contribution to the literature on the Tlingit, the Northwest Coast cultural area, Native American and indigenous studies, and to the growing social scientific and humanistic literature on space, place, and landscape.</p><p>"Thomas Thornton has written an excellent book: adroitly conceived, carefully researched, rewardingly informative. It provides a compelling example of how cultural constructions of geographic places shape and pervade experience, not only among the Tlingit - whose places, one discovers, are both plentiful and arresting - but also, by implication, among indigenous peoples elsewhere in the world." - Keith H. Basso, Regents Professor, and Distinguished Professor of Anthropology; University of New Mexico <p> "This remarkable and fine-grained ethnography . . . speaks to broad environmental questions and provides a powerful vision of the roles that place and landscape play in cultural systems." - Julie Cruikshank, professor emerita, Anthropology, University of British Columbia </p><p> "This book is a powerful testament to the complexity, durability, and sensitivity of Tlingit ethnoecology that allows us to appreciate more fully what it means to be a 'child of the land' as Tlingit characterize the relationship between clan members and the particular places to which they belong." - Eugene Hunn, professor emeritus, University of Washington </p><p> "This book will be a model for Native Alaskan cultural ecology. Case studies are illustrated with the lives of traditional Tlingit elders and the naming of particular places, showing how names, stories, songs, myth, legend, history, artistic designs, food gathering, and material culture (such as boat design) are specific to place." - Richard Dauenhauer, University of Alaska Southeast</p><b>Thomas F.

The four generations of Di Palos who have run this Italian specialty market have made it their mission to bring customers the finest old-world selections from Italy&#x2014;handcrafted mozzarella, buttery prosciutto, estate olive oils, traditional artisanal pastas from throughout the country. Now, in one colorful volume, Lou Di Palo, great-grandson of the founder and steward of the family legacy, shares the vibrant history of this storied establishment and a lifetime of wisdom about the cuisine beloved around the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Di Palo&#x2019;s Guide to the Essential Foods of Italy</i> takes you on a gourmet excursion through Italy&#x2019;s twenty distinct regions, from Sicily to Umbria to Alto Adige. Each chapter highlights a specific food and its rich history, along with practical tips for selecting, storing, and serving it at home. Many include signature family recipes that have been handed down through the generations, including Grandma Mary&#x2019;s Sicilian Caponata and Concetta Di Palo&#x2019;s Meatballs, or recipes gathered from trips to Italy over the years, such as Trapani-Style Salted Sea Bass and Polenta con Formaggio Crucolo Fuso. Readers will discover, among many other things, the secret to a balsamic vinegar worthy of sharing only with one&#x2019;s closest friends, the proper way to prepare the perfect espresso, and the importance of looking for the <i>Denominazione d&#x2019;Origine Protetta</i>&#x2014;or the Protected Designation of Origin seal&#x2014;which certifies that your food is a traditional, regional product. Complete with dozens of mouthwatering photographs, engaging anecdotes, and candid stories, and featuring a foreword by Academy Award&#x2013;winning director Martin Scorsese, this immersive volume is part family narrative, part culinary odyssey, and part cookbook. <i>Di Palo&#x2019;s Guide to the Essential Foods of Italy</i> is your ticket to the best Italian foods&#x2014;without having to wait in line!<br> &nbsp;<br><b><b>Praise for <i>Di Palo&#x2019;s Guide to the Essential Foods of Italy</i></b><br></b> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>&#x201c;Of all the stores in all the world, Di Palo&#x2019;s is probably my favorite.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Ruth Reichl</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lou Di Palo is single-handedly preserving the history of Little Italy in New York City.

I&#x2019;ve been behind the counter since before I was born. My mother worked at Di Palo&#x2019;s until the day she went to the hospital to give birth to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> For as long as I can remember, I&#x2019;ve sold Italian food, made mozzarella, and cut sixty-pound wheels of Pecorino Romano from behind the counters at Di Palo&#x2019;s just as my father, grandfather, and great-grandfather did. I don&#x2019;t work seven days a week from dawn to dusk for the money, nor does my brother, Sal, or my sister Marie. We could have worked half as hard in many other careers, but we wouldn&#x2019;t be as happy. This is the life we chose, the business we love.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book is not only about my six decades behind the counter, or the story of my family&#x2019;s store. It is also about the history behind the foods of Italy, and the traditions we love.<br> &nbsp;<br> I first went to Italy in 1973. I was twenty-two and on my honeymoon. Connie and I traveled from Sicily to Lombardia, stopping along the way in the rural region of Basilicata, where my paternal family came from. I would wake Connie up early to visit the places where our products were made, and the shops like ours that sold them. This trip changed everything for me: it opened my eyes to what I didn&#x2019;t know. Since then I have gone to Italy often to meet the people who make what we sell, to learn about the products firsthand and bring new ones back to our store in Little Italy.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t interested in visiting only the factories that made the cheese or the pasta, or a frantoia, where the olives are pressed into oil, though those visits are essential to understanding these products and explaining them to our customers. I wanted to take it a step further: I wanted to meet the cowherds marching the cows up the mountains, the wheat growers in the plains, the olive growers in the hot southern hills; I wanted to witness the traditions of all the foods that Di Palo&#x2019;s sells. My mission was to discover the world my great-grandfather Savino Di Palo left behind in Basilicata in 1903, when he came to the United States and eventually opened the first Di Palo&#x2019;s.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though my family is all from Southern Italy&#x2014;the regions of Basilicata and Sicily&#x2014;I made it a point to visit all twenty regions of Italy and every province within them. I went to Italy to meet the small farmers and learn how the products were made hundreds of years ago, as well as how the process is automated today. And then, and only then, could I come home and say that I know what I&#x2019;m talking about.<br> &nbsp;<br> I learned about products we sell by going to the source, and literally breaking bread with those who made these foods for generations. These people are more than my business associates: I spend days with them, share their meals, and meet their parents and grandparents. They tell me the old stories about how things came to be. Are they all true? Maybe not, but they areworth hearing, and it helps me understand the traditions. I am still learning, every trip I make.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this book, I hope to give you a sense of what it&#x2019;s like to travel through Italy, though this is not a culinary travel guide. I hope to show you how to identify a good piece of Parmigiano-Reggiano or prosciutto crudo&#x2014;but this book is not an encyclopedia with every little fact about every cheese or cured meat. Instead I have tried to capture the stories behind what you&#x2019;ll find at Di Palo&#x2019;s, just as if you came into the store in Little Italy. I want to tell you about the affinatore who wraps his cheese in sweet Alpine hay before he ages it. I want to describe the contessa with the magical olive groves in Sicily, the seventeenth generation of vinegar makers with a petrified chunk of 300-year-old vinegar in Modena, the old Parmigiano-Reggiano cheesemaker in Reggio-Emilia who likes to dangle his elbow in the warm leftover whey, as a cure-all for his arthritis. I want to tell you about the aroma of prosciutto and how to savor that long-lasting flavor. (Don&#x2019;t cut off the fat! It&#x2019;s one of God&#x2019;s gifts.) Hold a full slice up to your face and smell the country breezes of the hills of Langhirano, just as I have.<br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t just sell the food in my store&#x2014;I live it. This book is about living it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;LOU DI PALO<br> &nbsp;<br> A Century in Little Italy<br> &nbsp;<br> Before I tell you about the food at Di Palo&#x2019;s, let me begin with a little Italian-American history, and the mass migration of Italians to America between 1880 and 1920. My paternal great-grandfather, Savino Di Palo, was among them, and like so many others, New York City&#x2019;s Little Italy was where he landed. By the time he arrived in 1903, the neighborhood was essentially one large open-air market, the cobblestoned streets crowded with pushcarts and lined with shops run by Italian immigrants. You heard no English&#x2014;only Italian, and mostly dialect Italian. Little Italy was as segmented as Italy itself: Sicilians on Elizabeth Street, Italians from Naples and Campania on Mulberry Street, and on Mott Street, where my great-grandfather lived and eventually opened his store, a blend of immigrants from the regions of Puglia, Calabria, and Basilicata.<br> &nbsp;<br> Basilicata, where my great-grandfather came from, was then part of a larger territory in Southern Italy that the ancient Romans called Lucania, or &#x201c;the land of the wolves.&#x201d; Savino grew up in a small mountain farming town called Montemilone, where his family kept dairy cows and made fresh cheese. Life was hard in Basilicata, where the terrain was very difficult to farm. It has some of the tallest mountain ranges in Southern Italy, and in the nineteenth century most people spent their entire life on their particular mountain. Some still do. Even though the towns are geographically close together, they tend to be on the mountaintops, so it takes a long time to travel between them. It took Great-grandfather Savino a day just to get down the mountain to the main road.<br> &nbsp;<br> On a recent trip to the region, I went to meet a farmer outside the town of Stigliano who still lived in the mountains much as my great-grandfather had. His name is Mario Vaccaro&#x2014;vaccaro is Italian for cowboy&#x2014;and his melodious, singsong Basilicata accent sounds exactly like my great-aunt Nancy&#x2019;s. Mario is a shepherd and a cowherd who keeps sheep, goats, and podolica cows, which are found only in Basilicata and give rich, buttery milk. He cures his own sausages, bakes his own bread, grows some vegetables, and produces a little mozzarella, caciocavallo, and ricotta&#x2014; just as my great-grandfather did before he moved to Little Italy. Mario still heats his milk in a big cauldron over a wood fire; he still cleans his wooden tools with whey, and hangs his cheeses to age in the old curve of an ancient cave under his house where he lives with his wife and three children. He makes cheese by hand, often hunched over the pot of curds and whey on a little stool that must be twice as old as I am.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today this craftsmanship is rare, even in Italy. But Basilicata is still the most rural, dispersed region in the country, home to just 450,000 people and some of Italy&#x2019;s biggest mountain forests, some of which recently became pristine state parks. Imagine the culture shock for Savino to leave his mountain town and go to the most crowded part of one of the world&#x2019;s biggest cities, leaving his family behind&#x2014;a wife and six children. He wouldn&#x2019;t see them again until they journeyed to Little Italy eleven years later, in 1914.<br> &nbsp;<br> Opportunity, however, was not really what brought my great-grandfather to New York. Like many other immigrants, he&#x2019;d been told that there was &#x201c;gold in the streets of New York City.&#x201d; But the real gold was the ability to make money, to find work, which was then scarce in Italy. In my great-grandfather&#x2019;s case, he was in a feud with the noble landowners in his region. He was a poor subsistence farmer, a contadino, and from the nobles&#x2019; point of view, if a farmer grew three oranges, two of them belonged to the noble. My great-grandfather couldn&#x2019;t stomach this: he was a difficult man with a very short temper. But since the nobles held the power, Savino decided to join the migration to America.<br> &nbsp;<br> (Today my oldest daughter, Allegra, who married into a noble Italian family a hundred years after my great-grandfather left Italy, is now a contessa, and my two grandsons are counts. My great-grandfather is either laughing, or spinning in his grave.)<br> &nbsp;<br> It was probably a good thing that Savino was a tough man, because New York&#x2019;s Lower East Side, of which Little Italy is a part, was a tough place to be at the turn of the twentieth century. By 1910 he was living on Mott Street and had saved enough money working for a relative to rent a very small storefront half a block down in the heart of the overcrowded neighborhood. At this point, Italians were still one of the most discriminated-against groups in the country. It was hard for them to find jobs, so they created their own opportunities. Savino decided to do what he knew best, making and selling cheese. He opened a small latteria&#x2014;a dairy&#x2014;in between Grand and Hester streets.<br> &nbsp;<br> Milk was delivered daily in old-fashioned metal milk pails from the dairy farms that operated in upper Manhattan. Customers would come in with their own pitchers, and my great-grandfather would pull down the pail from the shelf and ladle out the milk. With the leftovers, he made ricotta, as he had done in Basilicata. He would also make mozzarella from fresh cow&#x2019;s milk and rounds of caciotta, a soft fresh cheese aged just a few days, the same way we do in our store today.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1914, Savino had saved enough money to bring his family to New York. He had an ulterior motive, the family joke goes: he needed the free labor. My grandmother Concetta, then fourteen, was immediately put to work alongside her father in the store with her brothers and sisters. By age twenty Concetta was married; she knew her husband&#x2014;my grandfather Luigi Santomauro, my namesake&#x2014;before she got here. Luigi was from the city of Potenza, and they arrived on the same ship in 1914. Luigi first worked as a barber, but once he married Concetta, an already skilled cheese-maker, he decided he was going to open up a latteria on East Eighty-Sixth Street in Yorkville in upper Manhattan, where there was no competition. The store was large and rent was cheap, but Luigi&#x2019;s shop lasted all of five months. Yorkville was a German enclave, and not many Germans wanted fresh mozzarella. So now my grandfather was out of work, and had a child&#x2014;my uncle Michael, who was almost two. My grandmother Concetta was pregnant with my father.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>George Liele&#39;s Life and Legacy: An Unsung Hero (The James N. Griffith Endowed Series in Baptist Studies)</h2><p>Writers of church and mission history have devoted very few pages to George Liele s ministry and most mentions ignore the global nature of his pioneer work, international influence, intelligence, and legacy. He launched a mission movement that reached from Georgia to Jamaica and from Jamaica to Sierra Leone and Nova Scotia all before the pioneer work of William Carey, Adoniram Judson, Richard Allen, and Lott Cary. Beginning as a slave preacher, Liele learned the Baptist story and theology a message he preached in South Carolina, Georgia, and Jamaica. In providing a comprehensive introduction to Liele s life and work, this book draws readers into identifying with Liele and those who lived through a difficult historic period and who in the process developed a theology that guided them through the challenges of being a Christian leader in a slave society. The Christian movement has always been greater than any individual or local church community has imagined it to be. In Liele s time, key leaders among the white church enabled a gifted person like Liele, despite his slavery, to develop his faith and leadership among blacks and whites, in spite of the perils of slavery. Liele was an organizer, mentor, church and school founder, an abolitionist, and a master negotiator. His roles have been documented by other scholars, but largely as footnotes or a tiny part of their analysis. Approaching the many parts of Liele s life and legacy globally, theologically, and historically, this book is the byproduct of a collaboration of scholars and historians who share the belief that George Liele is truly an unsung hero and one whose leadership and journey needs to be recognized at this particular time in history. Those reading these perspectives on Liele will find new truths about Christian ministry and missions.</p><p>David T.

Without it, the Bible would lack three early scenes: deliverance, covenant and worship. Exodus provides the events and narrative, the themes and imagery foundational for understanding the story of Israel and of Jesus. You can read Exodus on your own, and its main themes will be clear enough. But an expert can sharpen your understanding and appreciation of its drama. Tremper Longman provides a box-seat guide to Exodus, discussing its historical backdrop, sketching out its literary context, and developing its principal themes, from Israel&#39;s deliverance from servitude to Pharaoh to its dedication to service to God. And, for Christians, he helps us view the book from the perspective of its fulfillment in Christ.</p><p><strong>Tremper Longman III</strong> is Robert H.

Among his many published works are <em>How to Read Genesis, How to Read the Psalms</em> and <em>How to Read Proverbs.</em>&#34;Scholarly approaches to narrative structure and archaeological, historical and theological matters become practical through study questions that help readers appropriate Exodus in their daily lives.&#34; (Christian Century, May 4, 2010)</p><h2>Damia (A Tower and Hive Novel)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling fantasy author Anne McCaffrey &#x201c;interweaves an engrossing romance with a coming-of-age story&#x201d;(<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) in this novel in the Tower and Hive series.</b><br><br>Damia is the daughter of Prime Talents The Rowan and Jeff Raven.

The Course teaches that mind is always at cause, so the mind is where true change originates. The focus of this book is to deepen the understanding of how we can learn to choose and implement that change of mind, and consciously choose health and well-being. The change of mind is also described as undoing the ego, the false self, which then places us on the path to inner peace, the condition of health and well-being. There is a right-minded way of looking at oneself and the world and a wrong-minded way. Therefore, the purpose of this book is to further one&#x2019;s understanding and practice of the right-minded way, thus undoing the ego. Then, the real you can shine, and true health and well-being become your experience.</p><p>Cindy Lora-Renard is an international speaker on A Course in Miracles, visionary musical talent and writer, as well as a spiritual life coach, with a Master&#x2019;s Degree in Spiritual Psychology from the University of Santa Monica.

It&#x2019;s a given because they are regularly confronted by doubts about the meaningfulness of their efforts. Theirs is a kind of depression that does not respond to pharmaceutical treatment. What&#x2019;s required is healing in the realm of meaning.<br><br>In this groundbreaking book, Eric Maisel teaches creative people how to handle these recurrent crises of meaning and how to successfully manage the anxieties of the creative process. Using examples both from the lives of famous creators such as van Gogh and from his own creativity coaching practice, Maisel explains that despite their inevitable difficulties, creative people possess the ability to forge relationships, repair themselves, and find meaning in their work and their lives. Maisel presents a step-by-step plan to help creative people handle their special brand of depression and rediscover the reasons they are driven to create in the first place.</p><p>"<i>The Van Gogh Blues</i> is a mind-blowingly wonderful book.&#x201d;<br> <i><b>Midwest Book Review</b></i><br><br>"Maisel persuasively argues that creative individuals measure their happiness and success by how much meaning they create in their work.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br> Rather than shunning conventional treatments such as antidepressants and therapy, Maisel espouses confrontation with what seems like the existential pit of despair, the place creators often find themselves when looking for meaning in their work and the world. <i>The Van Gogh Blues</i> will help you remain true to your artistic calling and give you a medicine chest of tips and advice you can leverage if the Black Dog or another pernicious emotional booby trap snarls behind your canvas.&#x201d;<br> <b>Jeffrey M.

In 1916, Cathay was reprinted in the book Lustra without &#x201c;The Seafarer&#x201d; and with four more Chinese poems.

His influence extended throughout the 1950s and 1960s when, until his retirement from DC Comics in 1968, he created and/or wrote such memorable features as the Justice League of America, Adam Strange, the Atom, Hawkman, and, of course, Batman, all under the auspices of legendary comics editor Julius Schwartz.

Drawing from the ancient tradition of midrash, the author brings to life the inner world and the experiences of these women, weaving rabbinic legends and her own imagination into the biblical texts.

Miriam is not merely a figure of song and dance, but also one of revelation, a source of Torah. These stories were written to give biblical women the honor they deserve&#x2014;due to them as prophets, rulers, and teachers. The Introduction to<i> Sisters at Sinai</i> offers the rationale and the need for midrash - the writing in the margins - expressing how it can be liberating as well as deeply comforting. Perfect for women&#x2019;s studies courses, adult study groups, confirmation classes and book groups.</p><p>Now available in paper!Sisters at Sinai New Tales of Biblical Women <p>Jill Hammer </p><p>In this marvelous anthology of 24 stories about women in the Bible, Rabbi Jill Hammer draws from the ancient tradition of Midrash&#x2014;creative interpretation that elaborates upon the sparse details of the biblical text&#x2014;and brings to life the inner world and experiences of these unforgettable characters.

Robbins has won widespread acclaim for his powerful and splendidly researched novels of World War II. Now he casts his brilliant vision on one of the most terrifying--and most crucial--battles of the war: the Battle of Kursk, Hitler&#x2019;s desperate gamble to defeat Russia, in the final German offensive on the eastern front.<br><br><b>Last Citadel<br><br></b>Spring 1943. In the west, Germany strengthens its choke hold on France. To the south, an Allied invasion looms imminent. But the greatest threat to Hitler&#x2019;s dream of a Thousand Year Reich lies east, where his forces are pitted in a death match with a Russian enemy willing to pay any price to defend the motherland. Hitler rolls the dice, hurling his best SS forces and his fearsome new weapon, the Mark VI Tiger tank, in a last-ditch summer offensive, code-named Citadel.<br><br>The Red Army around Kursk is a sprawling array of infantry, armor, fighter planes, and bombers. Among them is an intrepid group of women flying antiquated biplanes; they swoop over the Germans in the dark, earning their nickname, &#x201c;Night Witches.&#x201d; On the ground, Private Dimitri Berko gallops his tank, the Red Army&#x2019;s lithe little T-34, like a Cossack steed. In the turret above Dimitri rides his son, Valya, a Communist sergeant who issues his father orders while the war widens the gulf between them. In the skies, Dimitri&#x2019;s daughter, Katya, flies with the Night Witches, until she joins a ferocious band of partisans in the forests around Kursk. Like Russia itself, the Berko family is suffering the fury and devastation of history&#x2019;s most titanic tank battle while fighting to preserve what is sacred&#x2013;their land, their lives, and each other&#x2013;as Hitler flings against them his most potent armed force.<br><br>Inexorable and devastating, a company of Mark VI Tiger tanks is commanded by one extraordinary SS officer, a Spaniard known as la Daga, the Dagger. He&#x2019;d suffered a terrible wound at the hands of the Russians: now he has returned with a cold fury to exact his revenge. And above it all, one quiet man makes his own plan to bring Citadel crashing down and reshape the fate of the world.<br><br>A remarkable story of men and arms, loyalty and betrayal, <b>Last Citadel</b> propels us into the claustrophobic confines of a tank in combat, into the tension of guerrilla tactics, and across the smoking charnel of one of history&#x2019;s greatest battlefields. Panoramic, authentic, and unforgettable, it reverberates long after the last cannon sounds.</p><p>"Like <b>War of the Rats</b>, Robbins uses his exhaustive research more as a background for a well-told tale with interesting and illuminating characters that ensnare the reader while at the same time giving them an inside look...<b>You can't ask more from historical fiction."<br></b>--<i>Denver Post<br><br></i>David L.

Near the small Belgian municipality of Waterloo, two large, hastily mobilized armies faced each other to decide the future of Europe&#x2014;Napoleon's forces on one side, and the Duke of Wellington on the other.<br><br>With so much at stake, neither commander could have predicted that the battle would be decided by the Second Light Battalion, King's German Legion, which was given the deceptively simple task of defending the Haye Sainte farmhouse, a crucial crossroads on the way to Brussels. In <i>The Longest Afternoon</i>, Brendan Simms recounts how these 400-odd riflemen beat back wave after wave of French infantry until finally forced to withdraw, but only after holding up Napoleon for so long that he lost the overall contest. Their actions alone decided the most influential battle in European history. Drawing on previously untapped eye-witness reports for accurate and vivid details of the course of the battle, Simms captures the grand choreography and pervasive chaos of Waterloo: the advances and retreats, the death and the maiming, the heroism and the cowardice. He describes the gallant fighting spirit of the French infantrymen, who clambered over the bodies of their fallen comrades as they assaulted the heavily fortified farmhouse&#x2014;and whose bravery was only surpassed by that of their opponents in the Second Light Battalion. Motivated by opposition to Napoleonic tyranny, dynastic loyalty to the King of England, German patriotism, regimental camaraderie, personal bonds of friendship, and professional ethos, the battalion suffered terrible casualties and fought tirelessly for many long hours, but refused to capitulate or retreat until the evening, by which time the Prussians had arrived on the battlefield in large numbers.<br><br>In reorienting Waterloo around the Haye Sainte farmhouse, Simms gives us a riveting new account of the famous battle&#x2014;an account that reveals, among other things, that Napoleon came much closer than is commonly thought to winning it. A heroic tale of 400 soldiers who changed the course of history, <i>The Longest Afternoon</i> will become an instant classic of military history.<br></p><p><b>Brendan Simms</b> is a professor in the History of International Relations and fellow at Peterhouse College, Cambridge. The author of <i>Europe</i>, shortlisted for the Lionel Gelber Prize, he lives in Cambridge, England.<br><i><b>Battles and Book Reviews</b></i><br> Simms writes from the perspective of the mud-caked battlefield. As a result, Wellington's victory is presented in all its savagery, vainglory, and desperation.... [I]t would seem that Waterloo was fought by soldiers who were tortured by right and wrong alike, men who intended to accomplish far more than killing.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Military Review</b></i><br> Through his clever ability to entwine first-person accounting with historical narrative, Simms allows the reader to explore the many facets of the battle in detailed depth and vivid focus This is a very authoriative piece. Between the number of powerful first-person accounts and detailed historical events, the book reads as a minute-by-minute eyewitness accounting. The deliberate story line and powerful detailing leaves little room for question The greatest attraction of this book is its ability to tell the story of the battle in a very realistic sense The reader is drawn into the history and given insight to feel the accountings in a very real and pragmatic fashion.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Military History</b></i><br> Simms recounts the fight from a fresh angle, delivering a thoroughly satisfying addition to a vast genre....

An overview of battle often dehumanizes, describing units of men as mere chess pieces. This book joins many others that attempt to remedy that. There is so much more to be said about Waterloo, how it came to happen, its grand strategic impulses and consequences, Napoleonic warfare in general etc. But as a battle itself is performed by numerous actors in various positions, to be able to see one segment with such accuracy is instructive. Brendan Simms has done an admirable job.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Library Journal</b></i><b>, starred review</b><br> Simms does an admirable job of showing that stories do still count.

The event shook her deeply and eventually led her to enroll in a PhD program to research NDEs. The findings, along with the profound spiritual lessons that she has gleaned from her work, are published here.<br> &nbsp;<br> During her academic work, Dr. Sartori studied three samples of ICU patients during a five year period. The first consisted of 243 patients from the first year of data collection who survived their ICU experience. Of those, two experienced an NDE, and two an out-of-body experience (OBE). The second cohort consisted of survivors of cardiac arrest during the five year period. Of those, 39 patients (or 18%) experienced an NDE. The third cohort consisted of all the patients who experienced an NDE during the five year period. Their stories are captured in her new book.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> One patient in particular, patient number 10, stands out for Dr. Sartori. &#x201c;He was in bad condition,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;When we put him into bed he was unconscious and unresponsive. Later he reported an OBE. He was accurately able to tell us which doctor was in the room and what he had said while he was unconscious. He claimed to have met his deceased father and a Jesus-like figure. But the most extraordinary part was that afterwards he was able to use his hand, which had been paralyzed since birth. There is no medical explanation for how that healing occurred.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When asked about the biggest takeaway from her research, Dr. Sartori says, &#x201c;In medicine, we&#x2019;re trained to believe that the brain gives rise to consciousness. My research into NDEs has made me question this prevailing paradigm, which admittedly is very widespread. The most important lesson for me has been a deeper appreciation for death and a whole lot less fear and anxiety about it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to detailing dozens of case studies, the book also discusses childhood NDEs, differences in NDEs among different cultures, and the after-effects of NDEs--one of which is the inability, in some patients, to wear a wrist-watch.</p><p>Dr. Penny Sartori PhD, RGN is an expert in NDEs and undertook the UK&#39;s first long-term prospective study. She is the author of The Near-Death Experiences of Hospitalized Intensive Care Patients: A Five Year Clinical Study and lectures both nationally and internationally. She currently teaches two courses she has written entitled Death and Dying as Spiritual Transformation and Science, Spirituality and Health at Swansea University. The author lives in UK.&#x201c;Nurse Penny Sartori was driven by an experience with a traumatized dying patient to study near-death experiences, not to pursue what might happen in an afterlife but rather to improve what happens in <i>this</i> life.&nbsp; Her goal was to learn all she could about the dying process in order to help her patients find meaning in their illness and restore a sense of well-being in their lives.&nbsp; <i>The Wisdom of Near-Death Experiences, </i>the fruit of her labors, is an invaluable resource for health care workers, for dying patients and their families, and for all of us who will face death eventually.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>- Bruce Greyson, M.D., Carlson Professor of Psychiatry &amp; Neurobehavioral Sciences University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA <br><br>"With more than twenty years experience of nursing dying people in an intensive therapy unit ,&nbsp; plus&nbsp; a&nbsp; Ph.D. in Near-death Experiences,&nbsp; Dr. Sartori&nbsp;&nbsp; is very well qualified to discuss issues of death and dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; She believes that NDEs provide us with a&nbsp; greater understanding of the dying process and that care of&nbsp; terminally ill patients&nbsp; could be enhanced&nbsp; if NDEs would more widely studied.&nbsp; A greater acceptance of the inevitability of death would help the situation of terminally ill people.

The man has entered our folklore.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br> Eleven years ago, wealthy Nebraska businessman James Herold gave his only son, Paul, a very raw deal. Now he wants Nero Wolfe to track Paul down so that he can make amends. But what if the young man doesn&#x2019;t want to be found . . . and what if he&#x2019;s the same P.H. who&#x2019;s currently on trial for cold-blooded murder? It&#x2019;s a case that will draw the great detective and his dedicated sidekick into a sticky web of deceit, one that will tax their resources to the utmost, and even cost them one of their own.</p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of the people who come to see Nero Wolfe by appointment, especially from as far away as Nebraska, show some sign of being in trouble, but that one didn&#x2019;t. With his clear unwrinkled skin and alert brown eyes and thin straight mouth, he didn&#x2019;t even look his age. I knew his age, sixty-one. When a telegram had come from James R. Herold, Omaha, Nebraska, asking for an appointment Monday afternoon, of course I had checked on him. He was sole owner of the Herold Hardware Company, wholesale, a highly respected citizen, and rated at over half a million&#x2014;a perfect prospect for a worthy fee if he had real trouble. Seeing him had been a letdown. From his looks, he might merely be after a testimonial for a gadget to trim orchid plants. He had settled back comfortably in the red leather chair.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I guess,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better tell you why I picked you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As you please,&#x201d; Wolfe muttered from behind his desk. For half an hour after lunch he never gets above a mutter unless he has to.<br> &nbsp;<br> Herold crossed his legs. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about my son. I want to find my son. About a month ago I put ads in the New York papers, and I contacted the New York police, and&#x2014;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing. Go on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was not nothing. Wolfe had made a face. I, at my desk, could have told Herold that unless his problem smelled like real money he might as well quit right there. One man who had made &#x201c;contact&#x201d; a verb in that office had paid an extra thousand bucks for the privilege, though he hadn&#x2019;t known it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Herold looked doubtful; then his face cleared. &#x201c;Oh. You don&#x2019;t like poking in a police matter, but that&#x2019;s all right. I&#x2019;ve been keeping after the Missing Persons Bureau, a Lieutenant Murphy, and I&#x2019;ve run some more newspaper ads in the Personals, but they&#x2019;ve got no results at all, and my wife was getting impatient about it, so I phoned Lieutenant Murphy from Omaha and told him I wanted to hire a private detective agency and asked him to recommend one. He said he couldn&#x2019;t do that, but I can be pretty determined when I want to, and he gave me your name. He said that on a job like finding a missing person you yourself wouldn&#x2019;t be much because you were too fat and lazy, but that you had two men, one named Archie Goodwin and one named Saul Panzer, who were tops for that kind of work. So I wired you for an appointment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe made the noise he uses for a chuckle, and moved a finger to indicate me. &#x201c;This is Mr. Goodwin. Tell him about it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in your employ, isn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. My confidential assistant.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll tell you. I like to deal with principals. My son Paul is my only son&#x2014;I have two daughters. When he graduated from college, the University of Nebraska, I took him into my business, wholesale hardware. That was in nineteen forty-five, eleven years ago. He had been a little wild in college, but I thought he would settle into the harness, but he didn&#x2019;t. He stole twenty-six thousand dollars of the firm&#x2019;s money, and I kicked him out.&#x201d; His straight thin mouth tightened a little. &#x201c;Out of the business and out of the house. He left Omaha and I never saw him again. I didn&#x2019;t want to see him, but now I do and my wife does. One month ago, on March eighth, I learned that he didn&#x2019;t take that money. I learned who did, and it has been proven beyond all doubt. That&#x2019;s being attended to, the thief is being taken care of, and now I want to find my son.&#x201d; He got a large envelope from his pocket, took things from it, and left his chair. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a picture of him, taken in June nineteen forty-five, the latest one I have.&#x201d; He handed me one too. &#x201c;Here are six copies of it, and of course I can get more.&#x201d; He returned to the chair and sat. &#x201c;He got a raw deal and I want to make it square with him. I have nothing to apologize for, because at the time there was good evidence that he had taken the money, but now I know he didn&#x2019;t and I&#x2019;ve got to find him. My wife is very impatient about it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The picture was of a round-cheeked kid in a mortarboard and gown, with a dimple in his chin. No visible resemblance to his father. As for the father, he certainly wasn&#x2019;t being maudlin. You could say he was bearing up well in the circumstances, or you could say he was plain cold fish. I preferred the latter.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe dropped the picture on the desk top. &#x201c;Evidently,&#x201d; he muttered, &#x201c;you think he&#x2019;s in New York. Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because every year my wife and daughters have been getting cards from him on their birthdays&#x2014;you know, those birthday cards. I suspected all along that my wife was corresponding with him, but she says not. She admits she would have, but he never gave her an address. He never wrote her except the cards, and they were all postmarked New York.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When did the last one come?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;November nineteenth, less than five months ago. My daughter Marjorie&#x2019;s birthday. Postmarked New York like the others.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anything else? Has anyone ever seen him here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not that I know of.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Have the police made any progress?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. None whatever. I&#x2019;m not complaining; I guess they&#x2019;ve tried; but of course in a great city like this they&#x2019;ve got their hands full of problems and I&#x2019;m only one. I&#x2019;m pretty sure he came straight to New York from Omaha, by train, back eleven years ago, but I haven&#x2019;t been able to verify it. The police had several men on it for a week, or they said they had, but now I think they&#x2019;ve only got one, and I agree with my wife that I&#x2019;ve got to do something. I&#x2019;ve been neglecting my business.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That will never do,&#x201d; Wolfe said dryly. Apparently he favored the cold-fish slant too. &#x201c;And no results from the newspaper advertisements?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. I got letters from five detective agencies offering to help me&#x2014;of course the replies were to a box number&#x2014;and quite a few, at least two dozen, from crackpots and impostors. The police investigated all of them, and they were all duds.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How were the advertisements worded?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I wrote them myself. They were all alike.&#x201d; Herold got a big leather wallet from his breast pocket, fished in it, and extracted a clipping. He twisted in his chair to get better light from a window, and read:<br> &nbsp;<br> PAUL HEROLD, WHO LEFT OMAHA, NEBRASKA, IN 1945, WILL LEARN SOMETHING TO HIS ADVANTAGE BY COMMUNICATING WITH HIS FATHER IMMEDIATELY. IT HAS BEEN LEARNED THAT A MISTAKE WAS MADE. ALSO ANYONE WHO SEES THIS AD AND KNOWS ANYTHING OF THE SAID PAUL HEROLD&#x2019;S WHEREABOUTS, EITHER NOW OR AT ANY TIME DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS, IS REQUESTED TO COMMUNICATE AND A PROPER REWARD WILL BE GIVEN.<br> &nbsp;<br> X904 TIMES.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I ran that in five New York papers.&#x201d; He returned the clipping to the wallet and the wallet to the pocket. &#x201c;Thirty times altogether. Money wasted. I don&#x2019;t mind spending money, but I hate to waste it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe grunted. &#x201c;You might waste it on me&#x2014;or on Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Panzer. Your son may have changed his name on arrival in New York&#x2014;indeed, that seems likely, since neither the police nor the advertisements have found any trace of him. Do you know if he took luggage with him when he left Omaha?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, he took all his clothes and some personal things. He had a trunk and a suitcase and a bag.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Were his initials on any of it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;His initials?&#x201d; Herold frowned. &#x201c;Why&#x2014;Oh, yes. They were on the trunk and the suitcase, presents from his mother. My wife. Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just PH, or a middle initial?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He has no middle name. Just PH. Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because if he changed his name he probably found it convenient to keep the PH. Initials on luggage have dictated ten thousand aliases. Even so, Mr. Herold, assuming the PH, it is a knotty and toilsome job, for we must also assume that your son prefers not to be found, since the advertisements failed to flush him. I suggest that you let him be.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You mean quit looking for him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. My wife and my daughters&#x2014;Anyway, I won&#x2019;t. Right is right. I&#x2019;ve got to find him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And you want to hire me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. You and Goodwin and Panzer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then I must inform you that it may take months, the expenses will be considerable, the amount of my bill will not be contingent on success, and I charge big fees.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know you do. Lieutenant Murphy told me.&#x201d; Herold looked more like a man in trouble than when he came in. &#x201c;But I can call you off at any time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Certainly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right.&#x201d; He took a breath. &#x201c;You want a retainer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As an advance for expenses. More important, I want all the information you can give me.&#x201d; Wolfe&#x2019;s head turned. &#x201c;Archie, your notebook.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I already had it out.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Flashman and the Tiger</h2><p>For the first time in four years comes a new book in George MacDonald Fraser's long-running series chronicling the adventures of Sir Harry Paget Flashman. Eleventh in the series, <b>Flashman and the Tiger</b> features not one, but three stories of international intrigue that find the fictional Flashman thrown headlong into historical events around the world. <br><br>This time out Flashman is thwarting an attempted assassination of Austria's Emperor Franz Josef ("The Road to Charing Cross"); getting to the bottom of the Tranby Croft gaming scandal&#x2013;and the Prince of Wales' involvement in it ("The Subtleties of Baccarat"); and, in the title story, impacting the Zulu war while hunting down a longtime enemy. At once meticulously faithful to fact and wildly fanciful, <i>Flashman and the Tiger</i> is an educational romp through the annals of history; thirty years after he began the series, Fraser is at the top of his game.</p><p><i>Flashman and the Tiger</i> is George MacDonald Fraser's 11th chronicle of Sir Harry Flashman, a "celebrated Victorian soldier, scoundrel, amorist, and self-confessed poltroon." Written with great wit and ingenuity, the series is presented as a succession of long-lost memoirs, which Fraser is simply editing for a modern readership. Thus does he interrupt Sir Harry's voice with footnotes, appendices, and tail-gunning apologies. Indeed, Fraser, whose editorial persona is humorless and academic, seems almost embarrassed in the presence of his subject's unbridled self-love.<p> This time the year is 1878, and Flashman is poking his nose into some deep political intrigue for a journalist friend who's done him various unsavory favors. Our favorite swashbuckler has just returned from Paris, where he was awarded the Legion of Honor. Yet readers familiar with Flashman's saga will know this is simply one more piece of tin to add to his capacious collection--and that even as he's revered by those around him, he finds it impossible to take himself seriously. Instead he regards himself as "one of those fortunate critters who ... are simply without shame, and wouldn't know Conscience if they tripped over it in broad day."</p><p> As usual, Flashman stumbles through history like a bull in a china shop. At the end of the first section, "The Road to Charing Cross," we realize that he's delayed the onset of World War I by various wranglings with the would-be assassins of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria. The following sections put him in contact with the Prince of Wales, a procession of remarkable whores, Zulu warriors, and yet more remarkable whores. Fraser's brashly perfect prose both fuels and awakens the imagination. And in the end the reader has to wonder: which wars almost came to pass, but were averted by a half-drunk war hero with a lust for life? <i>--Emily White</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Before I Let Go</h2><p><p><strong>A<em> New York Times</em> Bestseller!</strong></p><p><strong>From the author of the #1 </strong><em><strong>New York Time</strong></em><strong>s bestseller </strong><em><strong>This Is Where It Ends</strong></em><strong> comes another unforgettable story of loss, hope, betrayal, and the quest for truth </strong></p><p> Best friends Corey and Kyra were inseparable in their snow-covered town of Lost Creek, Alaska.

It also doesn&#x2019;t take a pretty girl with pigtails and a pooch named Toto to tell you that there is absolutely, positively, no place like home.</p><p>Just thinking about wizards and terriers makes me wish I were Dorothy&#x2014;sleepily opening my eyes to Auntie Em placing a cold rag on my forehead. In my case it would be Kissie sitting at my bedside with a jumbo cold compress. &#x201c;Wake up, baby,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve just had a bad bad dream.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a dream all right, it just wasn&#x2019;t mine.</p><p>Fourteen months and a mound of heartache later, my compass is pointing south again, and my speedometer is creeping toward eighty. Despite having three unlikely Vermont comrades helping me to find the road back, an old German wicked witch named Helga hindered that road, making it rockier than the Appalachian Trail not twenty miles from the front door of my Vermont inn. Not only did she swindle me out of both my business and my marriage, she despised my own terrier&#x2014;a small, helpless Yorkie by the name of Princess Grace Kelly. Gracie couldn&#x2019;t stand Helga, either; probably one of the reasons her little heart finally pooped out. Even though she&#x2019;s forever buried up in the freezing cold North, I&#x2019;ve got the cross from her grave sitting right here on the passenger&#x2019;s seat next to me on our way back home.</p><p>I can see home in the distance. The parallelogram of Tennessee on the welcome sign slowly emerges the closer I get. The February sun is setting to the right of it and as I roll over the state line my heart rate seems to slow down. A calm washes over me like a warm shot of Grand Marnier, sliding down my throat and coating my insides. It&#x2019;s been over a year since I&#x2019;ve been home and I wouldn&#x2019;t doubt it if I&#x2019;ve given myself early high blood pressure.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve been driving for three days&#x2014;my two little girls and me&#x2014;1,473 miles due south. Sarah and Isabella are in the backseat and I steal another peek at them in my rearview mirror. Their little heads are resting against the sides of their car seats, the monotony of the boundless pavement finally lulling them to sleep. For the first time all day it&#x2019;s quiet.</p><p>Since leaving Vermont, in one heck of a nor&#x2019;easter I might add, I&#x2019;ve paid equal attention to the traffic and my heartstrings. It is a wonder we haven&#x2019;t rear-ended anyone, and an even bigger one that my sultry grin isn&#x2019;t yet a permanent fixture on my face. Between New York and Pennsylvania all I&#x2019;ve thought about is the man who stole my heart&#x2014;and who, only hours ago, sealed our months of longing with a not-so-chaste kiss in George Clark&#x2019;s gas station parking lot. Peter Owen saved my restaurant and my pride when my husband left me for a blond bombshell with a face and bosoms only money could&#x2014;and did&#x2014;buy. Helga is the one responsible for their meeting, just one of the many &#x201c;wicked witch&#x201d; maneuvers she employed as part of her nasty scheme to repossess our inn.</p><p>The rest stops between Pennsylvania and Virginia were punctuation marks in my romantic recollecting. A stream of consciousness brewed in my mind: when Peter and I danced to Van Morrison&#x2019;s &#x201c;Into the Mystic,&#x201d; the first time I tasted his white chocolate mousse, and the moment in the kitchen after my inn&#x2019;s grand opening when we both knew the sparks flying weren&#x2019;t just from the faulty stove.</p><p>And now, in Tennessee, some seventy-two hours have passed but I&#x2019;m reduced to schoolgirl antics, playing our sole kiss over and over in my mind. I&#x2019;ve run that kiss through my head, every minute detail, a thousand times already. How he tasted, how his lips felt against mine, the way his tongue moved slowly around my mouth, and how my heart swirled and danced under his touch. I suppose I&#x2019;ll have to live on that memory until the first time he comes to town. Memphis in May, perhaps? That&#x2019;s the perfect time of year. He&#x2019;ll arrive for the Beale Street Music Festival and stay for the whole month. After all, May means Mud Season back in Vermont. And Mud Season, or &#x201c;The Thaw&#x201d; as the Vermonters call it, means there won&#x2019;t be any work for him there. Heck, the whole state practically shuts down during that time.</p><p>Springtime in Memphis, however, is glorious. We&#x2019;ll go to the Memphis in May Barbecue Festival and the Sunset Symphony together. We&#x2019;ll watch the ducks walk the red carpet at the Peabody Hotel and we&#x2019;ll hang out with Virginia and John, Mary Jule and Al, Alice and Richard, and we&#x2019;ll&nbsp;... the girls will die when I show up unannounced. I cannot wait to see the look on Virginia Murphey&#x2019;s face when I pull up in her driveway in oh, about eight more hours. I figure it&#x2019;ll probably be that late by the time my daughters and I go to a drive-through for dinner and take at least three more tee-tee breaks. She and John will be sound asleep but I&#x2019;ll call her cell and she&#x2019;ll answer anyway. It won&#x2019;t be the first time I&#x2019;ve dialed her at one in the morning.</p><p>Of course Alice, the bossiest of the three, will wonder why in the world I didn&#x2019;t come to her house. Mary Jule might be disappointed, too, but she would never question any decision I make. It&#x2019;s hard having to choose between three best friends. The only reason I&#x2019;m driving to Virginia&#x2019;s house is because, well, honestly, she knows me the best. You can&#x2019;t room with someone all four years of college, and every summer in between, and not know everything there is to know about each other. Virginia knows that I wax my bikini line, and I know about the few little hairs that grow around her nipples and how she sometimes lets them grow too long and forgets to shave them. Modesty goes out the window when you&#x2019;re living with someone you&#x2019;ve known since the age of five.</p><p>Alice and Mary Jule know plenty of my secrets, too, but there&#x2019;s just something about Virginia that soothes me. She&#x2019;s got a calming effect on my soul. Perhaps that&#x2019;s because she&#x2019;s never one time judged me about anything, or maybe it&#x2019;s just as plain and simple as the fact that we&#x2019;ve never been interested in the same man. Our types are completely opposite. She likes more of a girl&#x2019;s guy and I&#x2019;ve always been attracted to the guy&#x2019;s guy. John is perfectly happy to shop with her all day long. He&#x2019;s also the type to wear a Lily tie or lime-green shorts. I prefer the rugged look. I&#x2019;ll take a man who wears a Henley shirt over an argyle sweater, any day of the week.</p><p>Virgy&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what I call her&#x2014;and I just flat-out love one another. To this day, we&#x2019;ve never been in a single fight. Actually, that&#x2019;s not quite true. The closest Virginia has come to scolding me in our twenty-nine-year friendship was when I let my husband talk me into moving to Vermont in the first place. And now, truth be told, she had every right.</p><p>I got the idea from Mama. She had always told me that being a good wife meant following your husband. She claimed she didn&#x2019;t really want to move to Memphis, either, away from Greenwood, Mississippi, but she did it because it&#x2019;s what Daddy wanted her to do. &#x201c;It would have been one thing,&#x201d; she used to say, &#x201c;to move to Jackson. Several of my best friends from Ole Miss lived there.&#x201d; Kissie told me that she had once overheard a phone conversation between Mama and one of her friends. Said my grandfather told Daddy that he&#x2019;d teach him to be a great farmer if he&#x2019;d just dig his heels into the Mississippi Delta and not move to Memphis. He told Daddy that all the cotton land stretched out as far as the eye could see could be his, if he&#x2019;d just lay his roots down in Mississippi and leave Mama right where she belonged, in her own hometown. Like me, Mama was an only child.</p><p>But Daddy&#x2019;s roots couldn&#x2019;t be planted in the middle of a cotton field. Daddy told him, &#x201c;Mr. Grov&#x2019;a, I appreciate the off&#x2019;a, but I don&#x2019;t need your cotton fields. I&#x2019;ve got a cotton family business waiting on me two hours naw&#x2019;th of here and I won&#x2019;t have to get dirt under my finga&#x2019;nails. I&#x2019;ll buy your cotton and won&#x2019;t ever have to break a sweat.&#x201d; Daddy wasn&#x2019;t the farmer type. He&#x2019;d rather work out of his old warehouse on Front Street, or Cotton Row as they call it, right in the middle of all the buying and selling.</p><p>I was raised in a stand-by-your-man household, and I also happened to fall head-over-heels in love with a football quarterback I first saw in the tenth grade. Even though my red-and-blue cheerleading skirt barely covered my backside, Baker Satterfield never looked my way, all because my chest was flat. That all changed, though, the summer before my senior year. When I ran out onto the football field that fall, pom-poms raised high above my head, my bosoms had blossomed into a natural size D, almost overnight. That man took notice of me then, and after swapping class rings, numerous road trips from Ole Miss to UT, horrendous long-distance telephone bills, and a proposal that would make even Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara swoon, we finally tied the knot a couple of years after we both graduated from college. We had, at least at first, what I would call a wonderful marriage: two beautiful daughters, a gorgeous home in Memphis, lifelong friends, great sex, and a social life that involved peach daiquiris and other succulent activities. So when my true love told me of his lifelong desire to open an inn in Vermont&#x2014;well, I had to follow my man.</p><p>Turns out my man followed something of his own and left our barely opened B&amp;B, our girls, and our dog, not to mention our dream life, in my (then) manicured hands. Leaving my beloved Memph...</p></p><h2>Mad Hungry: Sunday Suppers: Go-To Recipes for a Special Weekend Meal (The Artisanal Kitchen)</h2><p>There&#x2019;s no better way to prepare for the coming week than with a comforting meal, and here is trusted cookbook author Lucinda Scala Quinn with a collection of her best recipes for getting the family together on a Sunday night.

He&#x2019;s stranded on the beach. Her brother runs for help, and many people rally to respond, but the tide is going out quickly and the whale is just so big. Still, Sally is able to sit near the whale&#x2019;s massive eye and tell him he&#x2019;s beautiful and strong, and that she will miss him no matter what happens. Master storyteller Jane Yolen and illustrator Melanie Cataldo have created an authentic portrait of vulnerability that is at once spare, moving, and honest.</p><p><b>Jane Yolen</b> is the acclaimed author of more than three hundred books for children and young adults, including the Caldecott Medal&#x2013;winning <i>Owl Moon </i>and the best-selling How Do Dinosaurs series. She lives in Massachusetts and Scotland.<br><br><b>Melanie Cataldo </b>is an illustrator who studied at Syracuse University and the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. <i>The Stranded Whale</i> is her first book. She lives in Massachusetts.Gr 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;While walking home from school along the Maine coast, Sally and her two brothers see a beached whale. With the tide ebbing, they rush to wet down the animal's tail and fins. After Josh runs to summon help, adult volunteers and Coast Guard members arrive. Efforts to move the whale prove futile. As Sally talks to it, the animal lets out "a huge sigh like the wind off the ocean" and dies. When a Coast Guard man present medals to the children, Sally expresses the irony to herself. "So, the whale died and we were heroes." Yolen masterfully conveys both the urgency of Sally's rush to save the whale and her anger and sorrow at its death. An author's note explains her decision to set the story in 1971, when lack of cell phones would delay the arrival of both helpers and broadcasters. She also discusses possible reasons for beachings, which usually end with the whale's death. Cataldo's paintings employ the grays, steel blues, and browns of a northern coastline. Clothing colors are also muted, and daylight gives way to evening, adding to the low-key and pensive mood. VERDICT This poignant story reminds readers that despite human efforts, not all living beings can be saved and honestly portrays the frustration and sadness that can result. A thought-provoking choice.&#x2014;Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State University Library, Mankato</p><h2>Tears and Tantrums: What to Do When Babies and Children Cry</h2><p>Are you baffled by your baby's crying or your child's tantrums?

Some also include beading for the berries. My favourite projects are the traditional samplers which I can&#39;t wait to stitch! As well as the 20 projects covered in the book, many of the motifs can be adapted for personal use; the smaller designs would make great quick to stitch cards for garden lovers. * Linda Rumsey * I enjoyed reading the author&#39;s comments on gardening and its influence before I even turned to the cross stitch charts. The charts themselves are in black and white and clear to follow. There are even tips for designing your own motifs and instructions should you wish to make the items that are shown in the book. * Janet Barnes * Gorgeous images. A retro vintage vibe to the projects, but with a contemporary and modern twist. I found the instructions clear, but the charts are a little small, so I would recommend a magnifying glass so as not to strain your eyes. But I particularly liked the use of Beads in the projects. Can&#39;t wait to get started * Safron Faulkner * Add a touch of floral magic to a wide variety of projects; all you need to know is how to cross stitch! It just takes a few minutes to learn and you have a new and very addictive hobby. There are over 70 individual motifs in here and over 20 projects to make, something for all levels and a varied choice of items to decorate. As this book was originally published in Japan it has a different layout, with instructions and charts at the back and a long section of glorious colored photographs of everything at the front. If you are a true beginner you will need to read everything carefully; stitch diagrams are simple to follow but could use some color variation to be more visible. My tip for the charts is to enlarge them all before working. They are in black and white and use symbols, nice and clear, but on the small side as there are a lot to fit into a modest sized book. Projects often have simple diagrams to aid with working. Decorate pillows, cards, notebooks, bags, kitchen towels, samplers and more with a range of violas, pansies, wild roses, poppies, wild flowers and Christmas flowers. All of the flowers will be familiar to me in the UK, and at the back of the book is a list of stockists for the UK and US. I like the botanical appearance of the flowers, reminiscent of those wonderful old books with plates depicting paintings of plants. If you want more out of cross stitch than kits and charts for pictures, then this is an attractive and useful book. * Rachel Hyde - Myshelf.com * June 2016 Now this is what we call beautiful cross-stitching! Inspired by her love of flowers, Kazuko has designed her love of flowers, Kazuko has designed 70 motifs that are simply stunning and have a real painterly feel. The phot of each design are gorgeous, and along with the charts for flowers, hedgerow berries and garden motifs, she has also designed beautiful projects for your home, from contemporary cushions, to a purse, coasters and even a journal. So whether you are looking to follow the designs exactly or just add that something special to a gift, you&#39;ll certainly find it in this book * Love to Make * A beautifully presented book with some great projects, some small some big. The charts are clear and easy to follow. For cross stitchers with some experience. * Lynn Gibbins * Such a beautiful book. This book is full of wonderful ideas and patterns with projects to use them. It starts with a gorgeous gallery of the projects and inspirations. For each project there is a little write up by the author about their inspiration, a gorgeous picture of the finished project, some close ups and in some cases pictures of the original flower or garden. It is very beautiful and inspiring, plus rather lovely just to sit and browse through. There is a brief section on tools and materials, quite enough to point the reader in the right direction to obtain supplies, followed by a techniques section which includes description and diagrams of the basic stitches, useful for the beginner or returner (like me). The main body of the book is charts and projects. The charts are simple and clear, with nice written instructions alongside. The other parts of the projects, such as creating the pansy purse, are clear, simple instructions with useful diagrams. So how to sew the purse and lining, then attach to the clasp, how to cover a journal with an embroidered cover, attach a zip to a pillow, use waste canvas. All with lovely photographs too. A very inspiring and beautiful book, it would be very easy to mix and match these projects with other patterns to create beautiful and unique pieces. All in all a book to both browse for it&#39;s sheer beauty and be inspired by. Highly recommend it. * Gill Colling * I was lucky enough to get hold of a review copy of this book from Search Press. I love cross stitch and love the satisfaction of completing a big design the most, and this book has both larger sampler designs and smaller flower designs that could be used for greeting cards. My favourite design which I would love to try and find time to do is a berry tote bag, which very effectively uses clusters of seed beads for the berries. I have never used seed beads in my cross stitch before, and I love the way they are used on this design. * Amy Cockram * I was given this lovely book to review. I found the book really easy to follow so I can do the cross stitches without difficulty. The pictures are also very helpful. I would definitely recommend this book to other people who enjoy doing cross stitching. * Laura Harrison * 20 projects and 70 individual cross-stitch motifs make this a must-have. I love this book. It is a treasure trove of good design. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. You will find all your favourite flowers - spring bulbs, violas including the larger pansies, poppies, roses, berries and wildflowers such as campion and clover. You can produce small cross-stitch pictures with these motifs, but you can also make any of the fabulous projects. I love the pansy purse and the gorgeous tote bag, the samplers and collages, the pin cushion tin lids, cushions, leaf coasters, apron and tea towels. All the projects are elegant. The charts are quite small and I would recommend that you enlarge them. The projects are quite small too, a pansy is approx 5cm square, just 2 inches. Most of the designs are done on 11-count linen. This is such a pretty and practical book. It would enhance your home or delight your friends if you gave the projects, or indeed the book itself as a gift. * Karen Platt -yarnsandfabrics.co.uk *</p><h2>C Is for Centennial : A Colorado Alphabet (Alphabet Series)</h2><p>Few other states in our union have the magnificent topography of the Centennial State.

As David J. Silbey demonstrates in this taut, compelling history, the 1899 Philippine-American War was in fact all of these. Played out over three distinct conflicts&#x2015;one fought between the Spanish and the allied United States and Filipino forces; one fought between the United States and the Philippine Army of Liberation; and one fought between occupying American troops and an insurgent alliance of often divided Filipinos&#x2015;the war marked America's first steps as a global power and produced a wealth of lessons learned and forgotten. </p><p>First-rate military history, <i>A War of Frontier and Empire </i>retells an often forgotten chapter in America's past, infusing it with commanding contemporary relevance.</p></p><p><p><b>David J. Silbey </b>is an associate professor of European history at Alvernia College in Reading, Pennsylvania</p>Chapter OneA WAR OF FRONTIER AND EMPIREA SummitPresident Emilio Aguinaldo sat beneath a mountain one December day of 1899 and wondered what had happened to his revolution. More than a year before, he had been the head of an Army of Liberation which controlled the great majority of the Philippine Islands. The Filipinos of that army had swept aside their centuries-long imperial overlord, the Spanish. All that remained for them was to take the capital city of Manila and declare themselves an independent republic.Manila did fall, but not to the Filipinos. Instead, a force of Americans won a series of shattering naval and military battles, captured Manila from under the noses of the revolutionary army, and then had the temerity to buy the islands from the Spanish crown. What the Filipinos had paid for in blood, the Americans had paid for with gold.Aguinaldo found to his sorrow that he could do little to prevent it. The follow-on conflict between the Americans and the Filipinos had run almost entirely the Americans&#39; way. Filipino defeat had been so stunning and complete that Aguinaldo had been forced to dissolve his government and army in mid-November 1899 and flee into hiding, hoping to reconstitute his forces as a guerrilla army and shadow republic.He could not even guarantee his own safety. Fleeing the central plains of Luzon in mid-November 1899, Aguinaldo was pursued by relentless American forces who were not stopped even by the near-total sacrifice of a Filipino rearguard. His bolthole, in the northern valleys, had been surrendered by a treacherous general. So now Aguinaldo, in mid-December, sat in the small settlement of Banane on the slope of Mount Polis and wondered what he should do. He could not stay there. The Americans were likely to catch up soon; in any case, Banane was inhabited by the Igorots, tribal warriors of uncertain loyalties. Aguinaldo and his escort had been greeted when they arrived by the kanao, an Igorot ceremony celebrating the taking of a trophy: the head, hands, and feet of an enemy. Whether the Igorots intended this as a warning is not clear, but Aguinaldo certainly took it as one. He and his sister, one of a number of women accompanying the group, wistfully discussed traveling in Europe once the war was over. Such fantasies, however, did nothing for the short term.Thus, on the night of December 16, in a grove near his camp, Aguinaldo called a council of war. He and his officers and political associates discussed what to do. The discus-sion was reluctant and difficult, with several officers refusing to give their opinion and preferring simply to follow Aguinaldo&#39;s lead. Aguinaldo himself remained cagey. Finally, Simeon Villa, one of his medical officers, spoke up and suggested that the group &#34;should separate from the women, who constitute such a great impediment or obstacle to any plan,&#34; and continue deeper into the mountainous highlands to find a place to hide and continue the fight. To this Aguinaldo agreed, and so committed himself to going on with the war, hoping that conventional defeat might be followed by irregular victory. He left behind family, friends, and allies to wage this guerrilla war, one that would last a further two years. That decision would not bring the Filipinos victory, but Aguinaldo would live to see the day that independence came to the islands, and know that it had in some small way originated in the efforts of the 1890s.1Geography and ColonizationThe geography of the Philippines imposes a sense of disconnectedness. Thousands of islands, roughly sprinkled through the western Pacific, make up the archipelago. The distances between the islands vary from a few hundred yards to many miles. It is possible to swim easily from Leyte to Samar, while Palawan sits by itself to the west, stretching for hundreds of miles into the Sulu Sea. At their farthest south the Philippines reach within a few dozen miles of the island of Borneo. At their northernmost limit the islands come close to Taiwan. To the west is the South China Sea, surrounded in the late nineteenth century by the colonial outposts of a range of European powers: French Indochina due west, British Hong Kong northwest, and the Dutch East Indies southwest. And looming over all was the massive, ponderous, and decayed Chinese empire, home to hundreds of millions and bloated by centuries of lacquered ritual. By the turn of the century China was less a nation than a prize: a target that every major power eyed with anticipation.To the east was the Philippine Sea, an open swath of ocean bounded by New Guinea on the south, a necklace of small islands farther east, and, to the north, Japan. By the last few decades of the nineteenth century, the power of newly industrialized Japan was becoming apparent. The Japanese had not yet had their coming-out party, the moment they stepped onto the world stage and announced themselves as a power of substance. That would come a few years later in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.In the middle of all this was the sleepy Spanish colony of the Philippines. Imperial Spain had acquired the islands centuries before, during the burst of exploration that marked the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Magellan had planted the Spanish flag there in 1521, and had planted himself as well, after an ill-considered meeting with hostile natives. Only one of Magellan&#39;s ships returned, captained by his first mate, Juan Sebasti�n de Elcano, who made it home, but, somewhat unfairly, not into historical memory. The Spanish were not the first outsiders to visit the Philippines. Certainly the great Chinese fleets of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries had stopped by. And Muslim explorers had broken out of the Indian Ocean even earlier, settling in some of the southern islands. But only the Spanish came to stay throughout the archipelago. In the 1560s, led by Don Miguel L�pez de Legazpi, who became the first governor and captain-general of the islands, they arrived in force, aggressive, imperialistic, and awash in the gold and silver of Central America.Spanish overlordship of the Philippines was more benign than their control of Central America. Critically, without silver and gold to mine, the Spanish had less need of slave labor to work to death in the dark underground. Instead, the Philippines, and the city of Manila in particular, served as the primary trading hub for the Spanish in the Pacific. They shipped silver from Mexico to Manila every year--the Pacific counterpart to the famous Atlantic flota that so obsessed pirates and privateers like Sir Francis Drake in the sixteenth century. From China came junks carrying silk and other precious items. The two met in Manila, and there the goods were exchanged for the enrichment of both sides.The Spanish brought with them a well-established body of law to organize and run the colonies, developed in the hard laboratory of Central America. Governors-general of the islands were, for the first few centuries, experienced men from either the Americas or from Spanish Flanders. The result was a thriving and sophisticated economy in the Philippines, a fierce trade rivalry with Portuguese merchants based at the Chinese port of Macao, and, not least, a growing Chinese population in the Philippines.2 It would not be the last time that the importance of the Philippines was seen largely for its relationship with China.The Spanish also brought with them a structured set of economic relationships, based on the domination of a Spanish elite, and a series of client-patron relations that would characterize the Philippines for centuries to come. People defined themselves in a complicated web of social networks in which a relatively small number of wealthy Spanish held the allegiance of hundreds if not thousands of both Spaniards and Filipinos. To call these relationships landlord-tenant would be to oversimplify desperately. The client-patron relationship might include landlordism and tenantship, but it was rarely limited to mere geographical allegiance. Clients looked to their patrons for a whole range of economic, social, and cultural protections, and patrons looked to their clients for corresponding services.Catholicism and EmpireBut perhaps the most critical European import was Ca-tholicism, and all the trappings of that church: priests, the Latin Mass, and the Inquisition. The lack of Spanish government interest in anything outside of Manila left the field open for the clergy, and the Catholic church--fired with the energies of the Counter-Reformation--soon developed an extensive network throughout the Philippines that, unlike almost anywhere else in Asia, converted a substantial majority of the populace to Catholicism. Many Filipinos might see no Spaniard but a friar for their entire lives. The conversions were long-lasting but not universal. Though the populations of the northern islands largely became Catholic, many in the southern islands remained true to their first conversion, to Islam.This reliance on the church for governing most of the Philippines had, however, an interesting side effect. Conversion was accomplished in the native dialects while masses were in Latin. The result was that, throughout Spanish control of the islands, the great majority of Filipinos never learned the tongue of the imperial motherland. A universal language was never imposed on the colony. The archipelago instead remained something of a Tower of Babel, with hundreds of groups speaking different dialects and unable, to a large extent, to understand one another.3Spanish power reached its height in the last half of the sixteenth century under King Philip II. But imperial Spain was--as happened so often with great powers--economically overstretched by its wars, its empire, and its appetites. Despite the massive influx of monies from the Central American mines, the Spanish throne went bankrupt a number of times during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The eighty-year revolution in the Spanish Netherlands, the Thirty Years&#39; War of 1618-48, and the rise of Dutch, En-glish, and, especially, French power doomed Spain to a long, slow slide from the top ranks.Her empire decayed along with her. The Thirty Years&#39; War, fought on a global scale against the Dutch, proved especially difficult for Spanish colonies.4 The Philippines themselves were taken briefly by the British in the middle of the eighteenth century, only to be handed back in a peace treaty, largely because the British were not interested in keeping them. The Central and South American colonies broke away in the first decades of the nineteenth century in a series of revolts that Spain could not prevent or defeat. Spanish Florida fell to the United States shortly thereafter. What was left of the empire by the late nineteenth century were remnants: islands scattered through the Caribbean, headlined by Cuba and Puerto Rico, and in the Pacific, the Philippines. Spain held them not by power but by indifference. None of the other great powers could be bothered to take them.Nor had the nineteenth century been kind to the Phil-ippines. The Industrial Revolution sweeping through the Western nations had made the Philippines into part of the global hinterland that fed raw materials into the voracious factories of Europe. Unlike the previous few centuries, when the Philippines were largely shut off from the world economy, the demands of the Industrial Revolution levered the Philippine economy open. From the Philippines came the raw agricultural product needed by the factories and back to the Philippines went the manufactures of those factories. Manila, Iloilo, and Cebu became, by the end of the century, large trading ports through which most of the Philippine economic transactions took place.5The result was demographic upheaval, as populations shifted in adjustment to the new economy. Hundreds of thousands moved inland--most particularly into the great central plains of Luzon--to clear the land and turn it over to the production of agricultural goods like tobacco and abaca fiber, which could then be sold to industrial nations. This frontier, inland rather than westward, created a society that--oddly--resembled nothing so much as the American West. &#34;The Philippines had pioneers and wagon trains, cattle ranching and rustling, cowboys and bandits, railroad building. . . .&#34;6But the breakdown of traditional societal arrangements resulted in an increased number of mortality crises throughout the Philippines, in which death rates spiked because of disease, famine, and dislocation. The 1880s were a &#34;decade of death&#34; for the Philippines,7 and the 1890s were not much better. The province of the Batangas on the island of Luzon experienced a smallpox epidemic in 1889 and a cholera epidemic in 1890, and lost most of its coffee crops to disease in the first years of the 1890s. In addition, the cattle disease rinderpest killed thousands of water buffalo, the main domestic farm animal of the Philippines.8The result was a society in economic and social flux in the 1880s and 1890s. The Spanish government contributed to this social instability by first appointing a series of reforming governors from 1880 to 1888 who opened up Philippine society and allowed limited political and cultural freedom, and then appointing the reactionary Gen. Valeriano Weyler to the governorship from 1888 to 1891, who undid the reforms, embittering many Filipinos.9RevolutionThis was the situation when the last decade of the nineteenth century opened. A declining Spanish monarchy, its gaze turned inward to past glories, ruled over a Philippines riven by demographic and economic difficulties. It should not come as a surprise that something approaching a revolution began. What started was less an organized attempt to throw off Spanish rule than an effort of different groups to shape violently the unsteady social order around them.To understand the revolution, we must understand the racial divisions within Philippine society. At the top were the peninsulares, Spaniards born in Spain. Below them were insulares (also simply called Filipinos), Spaniards born in the Philippines. Below them, far below them, were the indios, non-Spanish native-born Filipinos. The Spanish--peninsulare and insulare--dominated the Philippine society and economy. The indios--even the term had racist connotations--were forever ruled rather than rulers: &#34;The monkey will always be a monkey however you dress him with shirt and trousers,&#34; was one friar&#39;s summation in 1885.10But things began to shift slightly in the last part of the nineteenth century. Upper-class Filipinos (insulares) began to send their children abroad to be educated in Europe. This group came to be known as ilustrados. Among them was a young Filipino named Jos� Rizal. In 1889 Rizal and his friends were touring Europe where they went to see the Paris Exposition of that year. At the Exposition they saw a Wild West show, which included Native American performers on horseback. Struck by the daring and popularity of the performers, Rizal and his friends decided to form an association for Filipinos to assert their own identity, to make themselves &#34;braves&#34; on the American Indian model. Los Indios Bravos, they called it, a spectacular entangling of Spanish and American themes and ideas.Rizal positioned his group not as one grasping to elevate itself to the level of the Spanish-born elite, but as one seeking common cause with the indio. The group explicitly denied the ...</p><h2>The Art of the Fugue and A Musical Offering (Dover Chamber Music Scores)</h2><p><p>Among Bach's last instrumental compositions are two splendid works that reflect his genius for working complex contrapuntal figures into an expressive, apparently seamless musical texture. <i>The Art of the Fugue</i>, composed ca. 1745&#x2013;50, consists of nineteen canons and fugues that progressively illustrate the rich variety and complexity of fugal writing.

Over a period of twenty years White describes in minute detail the behaviour of animals through the changing seasons in the rural Hampshire parish of Selborne.

Shadaab Rahemtulla considers the exegeses of the South African Farid Esack (b. 1956), the Indian Asghar Ali Engineer (1939-2013), the African American Amina Wadud (b. 1952), and the Pakistani American Asma Barlas (b. 1950). Rahemtulla examines how these intellectuals have been able to expound this seventh-century Arabian text in a socially liberating way, addressing their own lived realities of oppression, and thus contexts that are worlds removed from that of the text's immediate audience. Through a close reading of their works, he underlines the importance of both the ethico-social content of the Qur'an and their usage of new and innovative reading practices.<br><br>This work provides a rich analysis of the thought-ways of specific Muslim intellectuals, thereby substantiating a broadly framed school of thought. Rahemtulla draws out their specific and general importance without displaying an uncritical sympathy. He sheds light on the impact of modern exegetical commentary which is more self-consciously concerned with historical context and present realities. In a mutually reinforcing way, this work thus illuminates both the role of agency and hermeneutical approaches in modern Islamic thought.<br></p><p><br><strong>Shadaab Rahemtulla</strong>, <em>Lecturer, Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations, University of Edinburgh</em> <br><br>Shadaab Rahemtulla is Lecturer in Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations at the University of Edinburgh. A Canadian Muslim of Indian descent, he received his doctorate in contemporary Islamic thought at the University of Oxford.<br><br>"...Qur'an of the Oppressed is an insightful contribution to contemporary academic discussions about Islamic reformism and Muslim movements for justice. Rahemtulla engages with his material in a structured manner and with intellectual curiosity and generosity. Despite his sympathy for liberation theology he does not hold back from critique. Each time, his critique points- albeit at times implicitly-to potential ways of imagining and furthering liberation theology." -- <em>Religion and Gender</em><p></p><br>"Shadaab Rahemtulla's timely book helps to fill a substantial gap in contemporary Islamic writing in the area of Liberation Theology ... Shadaab Rahemtulla has produced a scholarly and eminently readable text. For anyone concerned with how the Qur'an speaks to crucial contemporary issue -- gender equality, sexual orientation, race, poverty, patriarchy, economic injustice -- his work is going to prove indispensable." -- Christopher P. Clohessy, <em>Islamochristiana </em><p></p><br>"As this new monograph shows, Islamic liberation theology is ... an area that has not received as much attention as it deserves and continues to reward us with new insights into the complex picture of Muslim belief and practice in our time. Rahemtulla concentrates in particular on four contemporary Muslim intellectuals and undertakes a comparative study of how they read and employ the Qur'an ... his close analysis of how each reads the Qur'an in relation to particular concerns and political struggles yields a clear and concise piece of work that is easily accessible to readers without specialist knowledge of Islam, especially with the aid of the appended glossary. If only more academic publications could be so mercifully sparing in their use of unnecessary jargon and verbiage!" -- Mehmet Ciftci, <em>Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations</em><p></p><br>"For a world heartened by the rise of moderate Muslim voices calling for gender equity and respect for human rights, this is an important book. . . . <em>Qur'an of the Oppressed</em> is illuminating and could be the effective centrepiece of a course on Human Rights in Islam, including works of the four writers considered here."--Janet M. Powers, <em>Religion</em><p></p><br>"[T]his book is a useful exposition and analysis of an important strand of Qur anic exegesis produced by modern Muslim scholars. It is graced with a comprehensive index, a useful glossary, a list of Qur anic citations, and an excellent bibliography of primary and secondary sources. Rahemtulla is to be thanked for providing a compelling analysis, within a specific tradition, of the wider task of interpreting an ancient religious text so that it speaks to the present with a liberating timbre and power without falling into apologetics or idealistic essentialism."--<em>Reading Religion</em><p></p><br>"It gives an in depth and yet very accessible analysis of 4 modern authors on the Qur'an: Farid Esack Asma Barlas, Ashgar Ali Engineer and me. It not only introduces our work but contextualizes it and considers methods of modern Qur'an exegesis as it intersects with life and faith. I would consider this a coherent introduction to the field of modern Qur'anic studies. It is thorough and also weaves in other reformist thinkers and post modernist scholars...I think you will not only enjoy it, but also learn something. Highly recommended."--Amina Wadud<p></p><br></p><h2>The Myths We Live By (Routledge Classics)</h2><p><p>With a new Introduction by the author</p> <p></p> <p>'An elegant and sane little book. &#x2013; <em>The New Statesman</em></p> <p>Myths, as Mary Midgley argues in this powerful book, are everywhere. In political thought they sit at the heart of theories of human nature and the social contract; in economics in the pursuit of self interest; and in science the idea of human beings as machines, which originates in the seventeenth century, is a today a potent force. Far from being the opposite of science, however, Midgley argues that myth is a central part of it. Myths are neither lies nor mere stories but a network of powerful symbols for interpreting the world. Tackling a dazzling array of subjects such as philosophy, evolutionary psychology, animals, consciousness and the environment in her customary razor-sharp prose,&nbsp;<em>The Myths We Live By </em>reminds us of the powerful role of symbolism and the need to take our imaginative life seriously. </p> <p>Mary Midgley is a moral philosopher and the author of many books including <em>Wickedness</em>, <em>Evolution as a Religion</em>, <em>Beast and Man </em>and <em>Science and Poetry</em>.

He is the author of <em>Bishops, Clerks, and Diocesan Governance in Thirteenth-Century England: Reward and Punishment</em> (2014) and <em>The Shaping of Western Civilization</em> (2013).I had become increasingly disillusioned with Western Civ textbooks in general, largely on the grounds that they present a unified, uncontroversial narrative, which is not at all how historians actually understand the past. <i>The Shaping of Western Civilization</i> is entirely different, in that, by highlighting puzzles and debates, it actually shows students what historians do. I am also pleased with the low-cost production, as I teach at a campus with many students of modest means. If and when I teach Western Civ again, I will almost certainly assign this text. (William H. Campbell, University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg)<br><br>At last, an introductory text that takes the power of ideas seriously. Judicious and insightful, this book will treat students to the breadth and riches of Western civilization. (Gerry Bowler, University of Manitoba)<br><br>Instructors of a Western Civilization curriculum can nowadays choose from any number of textbooks, most of which are, in all honesty, perfectly good. But I know of no other textbook in English that I would recommend to undergraduates, graduate students, and colleagues as a thought-provoking read on its own merits. Burger's survey covers all of the expected factual bases, but it also challenges readers to reflect on the process of history-making itself, models enquiry for them, and calls attention to the structuring limitations on our pursuit of historical knowledge: evidence never speaks of its own accord, different questions require different levels of resolution, similarities among cultures serve to heighten the contrasts, past and present ways of looking at the world may be incommensurable, historians must beware of moralizing&#x2014;and all this just in the first chapter! This is a book for those instructors who believe that the goal of teaching history is not ito impart knowledge but ito provoke their students to a certain way of thinking.

Newton's physics also posed a profound challenge to our self-understanding, however, for the very same laws that keep airplanes in the air and rivers flowing downhill tell us that it is in principle possible to predict what each of us will do every second of our entire lives, given the early conditions of the universe. <br><br>Can it really be that even while you toss and turn late at night in the throes of an important decision and it seems like the scales of fate hang in the balance, that your decision is a foregone conclusion? Can it really be that everything you have done and everything you ever will do is determined by facts that were in place long before you were born? This problem is one of the staples of philosophical discussion. It is discussed by everyone from freshman in their first philosophy class, to theoretical physicists in bars after conferences. And yet there is no topic that remains more unsettling, and less well understood. <br><br>If you want to get behind the fa�ade, past the bare statement of determinism, and really try to understand what physics is telling us in its own terms, read this book. The problem of free will raises all kinds of questions. What does it mean to make a decision, and what does it mean to say that our actions are determined? What are laws of nature? What are causes? What sorts of things are we, when viewed through the lenses of physics, and how do we fit into the natural order? Ismael provides a deeply informed account of what physics tells us about ourselves. The result is a vision that is abstract, alien, illuminating, and-Ismael argues-affirmative of most of what we all believe about our own freedom. Written in a jargon-free style, <em>How Physics Makes Us Free</em> provides an accessible and innovative take on a central question of human<br></p><p><br><strong>J.T.

In addition to <em>How Physics Makes Us Free</em>, she is the author of <em>The Situated Self </em>(OUP 2007) and <em>Essays on Symmetry </em>(2001). She splits her time between Manhattan and the Sonoran Desert, where she is happier than anywhere else.<br><br>"Jenann Ismael's book is a strikingly original monograph that somehow manages to be perfectly relevant and highly engaging to both the intelligent lay reader and the professional philosopher. It shows how <em>well done</em> philosophy of science can be relevant for the public at large, even when treating questions that have, of late, suffered from the ravages of analytic metaphysics. The book may be more widely read inside the academy than outside, but those on the outside who read it in full will surely come away with a better opinion of philosophy than they had at the start.

Along the way, there were multiple affairs, four troubled marriages, a long battle with alcoholism, and a chilly relationship with her only child. <br><br>Attempting to channel her vague ambitions after an early marriage, Grace struggled to master the basics of drawing in night-school classes. She moved to New York in her early twenties and befriended Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and other artists who were pioneering Abstract Expressionism. Although praised for the coloristic brio of her abstract paintings, she began working figuratively, a move that was much criticized but ultimately vindicated when the Museum of Modern Art purchased her painting <em>The Persian Jacket </em>in 1953. By the mid-fifties, she freely combined abstract and representational elements. Grace-who signed her paintings "Hartigan"- was a full-fledged member of the "men's club" that was the 1950s art scene. Featured in <em>Time</em>, <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>Life</em>, and <em>Look</em>, she was the only woman in MoMA's groundbreaking <em>12 Americans</em> exhibition in 1956, and the youngest artist-and again, only woman-in <em>The New American Painting</em>, which toured Europe in 1958-1959.

Contains an additional essay, "The Realities of Practical Psychotherapy," found among Jung's posthumous papers.</p></p><p>This book gives the substance of Jung&#39;s published writings on Freud and psychoanalysis between 1906 and 1916, with two later papers. It covers the period of the enthusiastic collaboration between the two pioneers of psychology through the years when Jung&#39;s growing appreciation of religious experience and his criticism of Freud&#39;s emphasis on pathology led, with other differences, to his formal break with his mentor."An excellent primer to appreciation of Jung's contribution to psychological thought." (<i>The Virginia Quarterly Review</i>)</p><h2>Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique</h2><p>Contemporary theorists use the term "social construction" with the aim of exposing how what's purportedly "natural" is often at least partly social and, more specifically, how this masking of the social is politically significant. In these previously published essays, Sally Haslanger draws on insights from feminist and critical race theory to explore and develop the idea that gender and race are positions within a structure of social relations. On this interpretation, the point of saying that gender and race are socially constructed is not to make a causal claim about the origins of our concepts of gender and race, or to take a stand in the nature/nurture debate, but to locate these categories within a realist social ontology. This is politically important, for by theorizing how gender and race fit within different structures of social relations we are better able to identify and combat forms of systematic injustice.<br><br>Although the central essays of the book focus on a critical social realism about gender and race, these accounts function as case studies for a broader critical social realism. To develop this broader approach, several essays offer reworked notions of ideology, practice, and social structure, drawing on recent research in sociology and social psychology. Ideology, on the proposed view, is a relatively stable set of shared dispositions to respond to the world, often in ways that also shape the world to evoke those very dispositions. This looping of our dispositions through the material world enables the social to appear natural. <br><br>Additional essays in the book situate this approach to social phenomena in relation to philosophical methodology, and to specific debates in metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language. The book as a whole explores the interface between analytic philosophy and critical theory.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sally Haslanger</strong> is Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT, and directs the Women's and Gender Studies Program. She specializes in analytic metaphysics, epistemology and feminist theory, with an emphasis on questions concerning social ontology and social justice. She has co-edited three volumes: <em>Persistence: Contemporary Readings</em> (with Roxanne Marie Kurtz, 2006), <em>Adoption Matters: Philosophical and Feminist Essays</em> (with Charlotte Witt, 2005), and <em>Theorizing Feminisms</em> (with Elizabeth Hackett, 2005<strong>).</strong><br><br>"Professor's Haslanger's book provides the definitive account of what 'social construction' amounts to and what work it can do. I do not exaggerate. The idea of social construction is such an overworked trope, especially in literary and critical theory circles, that it seems to have lost much of its content. Contemporary usage tends to be sloppy and confused. Professor Haslanger's chapters on this subject are models of analytical rigor, while also accessible to a much wider audience than metaphysicians alone."--Elizabeth Anderson, Department of Philosophy, University of Michigan<p></p><br>"Haslanger's book contains thoughtful and innovative essays in the field of social construction." -- <em>Philosophy in Review</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>When Justice Fails: Causes and Consequences of Wrongful Convictions</h2><p>Wrongful convictions have become a prominent concern in state and federal systems of justice. As thousands of innocent prisoners have been freed in the United States in the past few decades, social science researchers and legal actors have produced a wealth of new insights about how and why mistakes occur and what can be done to help prevent further injustices. When Justice Fails surveys the field of innocence scholarship to offer an overview of the key research, legal, and policy issues associated with wrongful convictions. Topics include the leading sources of error, the detection and correction of miscarriages of justice, the aftermath of wrongful convictions, and more. The volume includes references to historic and contemporary instances of miscarriages of justice and presents information gleaned from media sources about the cases and related policy issues. The book is ideally suited for use in undergraduate classes which focus on wrongful convictions and the administration of justice.</p><p>Robert J.

An English professor in a sleepy college town, he spends his days browsing the Shakespeare shelves at the campus bookstore, managing his department's oddball faculty, and caring for his wife Marjory, a fragile shut-in with unrelenting neuroses, a condition exacerbated by her discovery of Tom's brief affair with a visiting poetess a decade earlier.<br> Then, one evening at the bookstore, Tom and Marjory meet Rose Callahan, the shop's charming new hire, and Marjory invites Rose to their home for dinner.

She lives with her husband in the Shenandoah Valley. Their closest neighbors are cows.</p><p>chapter 1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There she was, as welcome in this insular community as fresh air in a multiplex, a woman who, rumor had it, risked being happy. Tom had heard the most about her from Russell Jacobs, his colleague in the English Department, and now he was looking at her in the flesh, at this tall, slender, dark-haired creature, oddly stylish in her ill-fitting, baggy trousers and white T-shirt.</p> <p>She stood not twenty feet away from him in the new coffee room, listening attentively to one of a coterie of retired faculty members who, according to Russ, had glommed on to the Book Store&#x2019;s new assistant director as soon as she&#x2019;d set foot on campus. For Tom it was a moment to treasure. Here, at this isolated seat of southern learning, where everyone clung to busy-ness as though it were proof of an importance in the larger, more meaningful world, was a person who dared to seem relaxed, as though she had time to draw breath and listen to what someone was saying and even think about it for a moment or two. Imagine that!</p> <p>Her name, Tom knew, was Rose Callahan, and she&#x2019;d been hired by Ted Pitts, director of the Book Store, to manage the coffee room and &#x201c;to re-energize the community&#x2019;s co-curricular life of the mind through programming in the college bookstore.&#x201d; Whatever that meant. Over the last couple of years, Ted Pitts had become pleasantly obsessed with what he called &#x201c;building community.&#x201d; Everyone applauded his efforts except the college&#x2019;s new VP of finance, an attractive, fortyish Darden School graduate referred to unaffectionately by the faculty as &#x201c;the Harpy.&#x201d;</p> <p>The new VP had been hired a year ago, when the post-9/11 economy had forced the college to dip into its substantial endowment. Ever since her arrival, the Harpy had worried publicly that such frivolities as Mr. Pitts&#x2019;s &#x201c;community building&#x201d; further eroded the college&#x2019;s bottom line, which appeared to be the beginning and end of her concerns. Ted Pitts&#x2019;s hiring of Rose Callahan as assistant director (and community-builder-in-chief) was seen by everyone as open defiance of the Harpy&#x2019;s clawlike grip on the soul of the college. Much to the faculty&#x2019;s delight, Ted had always operated with quasi-independence, paying the Book Store&#x2019;s expenses with textbook sales, reinvesting the profits from trade books, gifts, and coffee sales in his &#x201c;community building&#x201d; efforts.</p> <p>Rose Callahan had been at the college for a full month, usually plenty of time for every detail of a person&#x2019;s past to be ferreted out and vetted. But, according to Russ (who was the campus gossip coordinator and so would know), there was remarkably little dirt to dish about Rose Callahan. She was thirty-seven and originally from Texas. She was either never married or amicably divorced&#x2014;Russ wasn&#x2019;t sure which, only that she appeared to live alone and didn&#x2019;t seem inclined to bite men&#x2019;s heads off. She was to move into one of the tumbledown cottages down by the old barn as soon as some busted pipes were repaired; until then she was staying at the College Inn. She had moved down to take the Book Store job from Charlottesville, where she&#x2019;d managed an independent bookstore on the Charlottesville Downtown Mall for the last two years, reportedly changing the color of its bottom line from red to black with her innovative programming. Rose Callahan could talk about books intelligently, Russ said, including the literature of the eighteenth century, which was Russ&#x2019;s own domain, and the students had begun pouring out their troubles to her on their first day back from summer break, which had been yesterday. She ate her meals in the dining hall and seemed equally comfortable sitting by herself or with a table of strangers, and she had been sighted walking miles from campus after work hours carrying binoculars, which indicated she was either a spy or a birdwatcher. Russ had thought probably the latter.</p> <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not at all pretty,&#x201d; Russ had said, leaning over Tom&#x2019;s desk in that stilted, locker-room way he saved for male colleagues who were part of his regular poker nights. &#x201c;I mean, her nose has been broken, playing high school basketball, of all things! Next to your beautiful wife, she&#x2019;d look like Olive Oyl.&#x201d; Russ, who was long divorced and nearing retirement age, still liked to think of himself as a gay young blade. He&#x2019;d raised his bushy eyebrows. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s remarkably <i>self-contained,</i> if you know what I mean. Everyone on campus is completely intrigued by her, because she&#x2019;s here all by herself and is still so obviously un-<i>needy.</i> And she never blows her own horn. Never. In fact, Rose Callahan doesn&#x2019;t talk much about herself at <i>all</i>. I don&#x2019;t even know whether she has a lover&#x2014;or if the woman is heterosexual, for that matter. I don&#x2019;t mean to imply she&#x2019;s necessarily keeping secrets or anything like that. She simply appears to find other people&#x2019;s lives more interesting to talk about than her own. But for all her frustrating reserve, Thomas, Rose Callahan&#x2019;s got something about her that will make the man in you sit up and take notice. Yes, Professor Putnam, even you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Tom had laughed at this, his eyes on his cluttered desktop, and thought for perhaps the four-thousandth time what a harmless old ass Russ was. Up until this moment in the Book Store, Tom would have bet his retirement fund there wasn&#x2019;t enough man left in him to lift its little finger, let alone sit up. But now, there Rose Callahan was, and here he was, alert as a small boy who smells freshly baked cookies.</p> <p>At that moment Rose looked up and smiled. Something inside Tom heaved and shifted and he thought, channeling his idol: <i>The very instant that I saw you, did my heart fly to your service.</i></p> <p>And just like that he, Thomas Marvin Putnam&#x2014;lover of Shakespeare, educated at Amherst College and the University of Virginia, dysfunctionally married for twenty years&#x2014;was a joyous, carefree child somersaulting down a hill, joining Alice in falling, falling, falling somewhere he had never contemplated going.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Tom&#x2019;s impulse was to run, but Marjory had begun plucking at the sleeve of his tweed jacket, her nervous fingers working into the hole under the leather patch that was coming off again.</p> <p>They were there for the Book Store&#x2019;s first annual &#x201c;Teaching English Afternoon.&#x201d; As Rose&#x2019;s inaugural program, its astute purpose was to bring the college&#x2019;s English Department faculty and current majors together with area high school English teachers and their best students, who were potential majors.</p> <p>The event, which had been a howling success for Admissions, was winding down. All other members of the English Department had left, but Marjory, who hadn&#x2019;t wanted to come, was now refusing to leave. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the new assistant director,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go over and introduce ourselves.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not <i>now,</i>&#x201d; Tom hissed, wondering that his riotously pounding heart did not burst through the front of his jacket and flop down on the display of new books spread out before them; wondering that his knees didn&#x2019;t buckle; wondering that he just stood there, probably still looking like the tall, dull, inoffensive, pleasant full professor of English that he was. But it was too late. Rose Callahan had excused herself from the retired faculty member and was coming toward them, her hand held out to Marjory. Her voice was warm and slightly twangy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Rose Callahan, and I&#x2019;m new at the Book Store. I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ve met.&#x201d;</p> <p>Tom saw with astonishment that Marjory was charmed into momentary sanity. She never shook hands anymore. Since his regrettable affair with a poet, she&#x2019;d developed wild phobias about germs and obscure diseases. Yet she shook hands with Rose Callahan and spoke to her as pleasantly as you please. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Marjory Putnam, and this is my husband, Tom. He&#x2019;s in the English Department.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very nice to meet you, Marjory,&#x201d; Rose said, taking a moment to focus on this fragile, nervous woman, standing there buttoned up to the chin in inappropriately immature flowered chintz. Tom was grateful for this small courtesy paid to Marjory. But he was even more grateful when Rose, at last, turned to him. &#x201c;Rose Callahan,&#x201d; she said simply, holding out her hand to him. &#x201c;You must be a colleague of Russell Jacobs.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her touch was cool, her hand unusually long-fingered and strong. Her handshake conveyed conviction and hardiness, both considered suspect feminine traits on this campus where some young women still wore strings of real pearls with their designer jeans. Tom felt a small jolt as their palms connected. Rose looked down at their hands with an expression he could not read. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I am.&#x201d; He intended to say something else, something witty about Russ, but not another word came out of his mouth.</p> <p>There was an infinitesimal pause before Rose said to Marjory, &#x201c;Russell has been very nice to me.&#x201d; Tom noticed she was much taller than Marjory, who only came up to his own heart. For an instant, Tom saw his wife the way he&#x2019;d first seen her, as an exquisite china doll, immensely chippable. It was, perhaps, the most accurate read he could have taken of her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Marjory said, battling nervousness again, looking down and picking at the clasp of her purse. Marjory was profoundly uncomfortable around Russ. He was too confident for her by half.</p> <p>Rose smiled, but then thinking about Russ made most people other than Marjory smile. Rose turned to Tom again. &#x201c;Russell has introduced me to a dizzying number of people and told me all about them.&#x201d; Now their eyes were meeting. Rose Callahan&#x2019;s eyes were truly blue, Paul Newman blue, and as he looked into them her whole being seemed to glow, as though she herself generated light.</p> <p>The Bard, ever present in Tom&#x2019;s head and ever willing to think the right words when he could not, pointed out that <i>light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile.</i> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he managed. &#x201c;Russ is the self-proclaimed social maven around here.&#x201d; Tom was pleased with himself for using the word &#x201c;maven&#x201d; and then immediately uncomfortable with feeling pleased. It had been years since he&#x2019;d been concerned about the impression he was making on anyone. The back of Tom&#x2019;s neck began to itch unbearably, and his left middle toe threatened to cramp. He wished he&#x2019;d remembered to get a haircut. His brown hair became a mass of rampaging cowlicks when he put off going to the barber.</p> <p>Marjory stirred by his side, letting off an unusual little pop of energy. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you come have supper with us this Friday night, Rose? We&#x2019;ll celebrate getting through the first week of having the students back. We live right on campus, and we&#x2019;d love to have you, wouldn&#x2019;t we, Tom?&#x201d;</p> <p>Tom stopped staring at Rose Callahan and turned to stare at his wife. Marjory hadn&#x2019;t issued a social invitation in ten years. Was she drunk at three o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon? Had she taken too many of her happy pills? A decade ago, his wife had sunk into pathological timidity and indecisiveness, especially around strange women.</p> <p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t we, Tom?&#x201d; Marjory repeated, as calmly as though there were nothing at all unusual about what she&#x2019;d said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; The words came out rather louder than Tom would have wished. He turned back to Rose Callahan, feeling a rush of almost adolescent despair. She would think he was a dolt now, for sure. One of those moldy academics who can&#x2019;t really function in any world other than the one inside his own head. &#x201c;Do come,&#x201d; he said, hearing himself, with just those two words, sound as though he were begging.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to,&#x201d; she said, smiling at Marjory. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so nice of you to ask me.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was as though some of Rose Callahan&#x2019;s calm, some of her <i>sanity,</i> had flowed into Marjory by osmosis. This was the longest social interaction Tom could remember his wife having in years. &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Shall we say seven o&#x2019;clock? We live at the very end of Faculty Row&#x2014;the big, square brick house that&#x2019;s a bit set back from the rest. My mother lives with us, and I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll want to join us.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How very nice. It will be a treat to eat dinner again in a real house with a real family for a change,&#x201d; Rose said, sounding as though the prospect of spending an evening with Marjory&#x2019;s mother really did fill her with pleasurable expectation. Of course, rumor could work both ways, and the stories Rose would have heard about his mother-in-law might have intrigued her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you on Friday, then, if not before,&#x201d; Rose said to Marjory. Then she turned to Tom again. &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; she said, almost shyly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided to go back to school and finish my degree, and I&#x2019;m signed up for one of your classes&#x2014;Shakespeare 402 that meets on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons?&#x201d;</p> <p>The light was there again, flaring out as though someone had set off a Roman candle behind Rose Callahan&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Tom said. His heart did another flop, and his left middle toe seized up like an oil-less engine. &#x201c;It meets from two thirty until four forty-five tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Rose Callahan smiled again, still shy, and added, &#x201c;Well then, I&#x2019;ll see <i>you</i> tomorrow afternoon.&#x201d;</p> <p>Tom looked quickly at his wife to see if she minded this. Marjory had been known to start keening like an Irish mother if he so much as nodded to another woman at a party. But Marjory was smiling as though she were as normal as the next person.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Rose leaned against the archway that separated the coffee room from the main part of the Book Store and watched the Putnams leave. She&#x2019;d been at the college for three weeks and three days and had already heard a lot about Marjory Putnam, particularly from Russell Jacobs. Everyone had said Marjory was very peculiar, but no one had said a word about how lovely she was. Or that she was so friendly. To be fair to the gossipers, Marjory was obviously a tad high-strung. There had been real effort behind her friendliness, as though it were rusty or in disrepair. And Marjory&#x2019;s fingers had begun to hop around like grasshoppers in the folds of her dress when Russell&#x2019;s name had come up. But those two things, on their own, didn&#x2019;t have to mean Marjory Putnam was <i>peculiar,</i> only that she was shy and the thought of bombastic Russell Jacobs made her nervous.</p> <p>As Rose watched from her archway, the Putnams stopped abruptly beside one of the many glass shelves of knickknacks in the Book Store&#x2019;s front room. The two of them stood there, whispering together; or rather Professor Putnam whispered while Marjory lowered her head, wrung her hands, and listened. Professor Putnam then put a hand on his wife&#x2019;s arm in an obvious attempt to get her moving again, but Marjory shook her head like an obstinate child, took a step away from him, and turned back to look at Rose. Her body had gone rigid as a poker, and her face was a blank. She didn&#x2019;t wave, but Rose did wave at her, and in response Marjory lifted her hand and held it in the air. The two stood looking at each other, and Rose felt something protective rear up inside her and attach itself to the other woman. She would have sworn Marjory recognized this, for she nodded once and smiled for a beat of Rose&#x2019;s heart. She then went back to staring. Only it wasn&#x2019;t a simple stare. It was the stare of a blind woman who sees with her entire being, senses things beyond what other people are capable of noticing.</p> <p><i>She&#x2019;s been potty for years,</i> Russell had said, with absolutely no compunction about branding someone Rose had never met as a loony. <i>You can ask anyone, Rose, my dear. Everyone has Marjory stories to tell. Anyone except for Tom would have fled years ago. But Professor Putnam is our campus Boy Scout, our token nice guy. The only man I know who can act truly selflessly.

W. Singer asks "What about the business executives?" Breaking out of the guns-for-hire mold of traditional mercenaries, corporations now sell skills and services that until recently only state militaries possessed. Their products range from trained commando teams to strategic advice from generals. This new "Privatized Military Industry" encompasses hundreds of companies, thousands of employees, and billions of dollars in revenue. Whether as proxies or suppliers, such firms have participated in wars in Africa, Asia, the Balkans, and Latin America. More recently, they have become a key element in U.S. military operations. Private corporations working for profit now sway the course of national and international conflict, but the consequences have been little explored. </p><p>In this book, Singer provides the first account of the military services industry and its broader implications. <i>Corporate Warriors</i> includes a description of how the business works, as well as portraits of each of the basic types of companies: military providers that offer troops for tactical operations; military consultants that supply expert advice and training; and military support companies that sell logistics, intelligence, and engineering. </p><p>In an updated edition of P. W. Singer's classic account of the military services industry and its broader implications, the author describes the continuing importance of that industry in the Iraq War. This conflict has amply borne out Singer's argument that the privatization of warfare allows startling new capabilities and efficiencies in the ways that war is carried out. At the same time, however, Singer finds that the introduction of the profit motive onto the battlefield raises troubling questions&#x2015;for democracy, for ethics, for management, for human rights, and for national security.</p></p><p>"After reading this book, it is impossible to see the landscape of insurgencies, civil wars, and inter-state wars the same way again. Peter Singer's book is a rare find: a study of the breakdown of the state monopoly on war that challenges basic assumptions in international relations theory; an exploration of the many different ways in which privatized military firms pose both problems and opportunities for policymakers; and a fascinating read for anyone interested in the changing nature of both international security and international politics."--Anne-Marie Slaughter, Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University <p> </p><p>"A must read for anyone interested in the art of war, Corporate Warriors is a fascinating analysis of a new, often secretive, global industry. Marked by impressive research, this path-breaking study describes a pattern of increasing reliance on private military firms by individuals, corporations, humanitarian groups, governments, and international organizations. This is a masterful book that will appeal to students, scholars, policymakers, and lay readers alike."--Stephanie G.

Indians are the poorest people in the United States, and their reservations are appallingly poverty-stricken; not surprisingly, they suffer from the numerous social pathologies that invariably accompany such economic conditions. Historically, most tribal communities were prosperous, composed of healthy, vibrant societies sustained over hundreds and in some instances perhaps even thousands of years. By creating sustainable economic development on reservations, however, gradual long-term change can be effected, thereby improving the standard of living and sustaining tribal cultures.<br></p><p><i>Reservation &#x201c;Capitalism&#x201d;</i> relates the true history, describes present-day circumstances, and sketches the potential future of Indian communities and economics. It provides key background information on indigenous economic systems and property-rights regimes in what is now the United States and explains how the vast majority of Native lands and natural resource assets were lost. Robert J. Miller focuses on strategies for establishing public and private economic activities on reservations and for creating economies in which reservation inhabitants can be employed, live, and have access to the necessities of life, circumstances ultimately promoting complete tribal self-sufficiency.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>American Indians are the poorest people in the United States, and their reservations are the most poverty-stricken; as a result, they suffer from numerous social pathologies that accompany these economic conditions.

Higgins get to the heart of Nietzsche's philosophy, from his ideas on "the will to power" to his attack on religion and morality and his infamous <i>�bermensch</i> (superman).<br><b>What Nietzsche Really Said</b> offers both guidelines and insights for reading and understanding this controversial thinker. Written with sophistication and wit, this book provides an excellent summary of the life and work of one of history's most provocative philosophers.</p><p>Kathleen Higgins and Robert Solomon's comprehensive, lucid, and often humorous overview of Nietzsche's philosophy sings with the joy of his own work--a joy, the authors point out, that is often misunderstood or overlooked. Central to Nietzsche's thought is the call to celebrate life for its own sake. Yet, as Nietzsche himself realized, this often requires provocation. Through both the style and substance of his work, Nietzsche sought to inspire heated dialogue, encouraging readers "to say yes to philosophy, and to life." Many factors get in the way of recognizing and rising to the challenge, however--not the least of which are the rumors surrounding his life, work, and sympathies; his provocative views and prose; and his vivid attacks on systems of thought and individuals. With sense and sensitivity, Higgins and Solomon, both philosophy professors at the University of Texas at Austin, debunk 30 common rumors, offer questions to help guide our reading, provide brief annotations of Nietzsche's works, and examine his heroes and nemeses (sometimes the same people). In addition, they thoughtfully assess concepts central to Nietzsche's philosophy, including those critical to his "affirmative philosophy." This thorough approach, combined with clear writing and a sense of playfulness (attributes Nietzsche would have appreciated), offers insight into Nietzsche's philosophy without sacrificing its nuance or power--a substantial gift, indeed. <i>--Stephanie Wickersham</i>"Solomon and Higgins have put together a survival kit for those intending an expedition into Nietzsche territory, a refresher course for those who have been there, a map of the danger spots, and an encyclopedia of the main wonders.

This new edition is true to the original, first published in 1891. Italian text. Italian description: Con le sue 790 ricette, raccolte dall&#39;autore con scrupolo e passione nel giro dei lunghi anni e innumerevoli viaggi, l&#39;Artusi � il libro pi� famoso e letto sulla cucina italiana, quello da cui tutti i grandi cuochi dell&#39;ultimo secolo hanno tratto ispirazioni e suggerimenti. Un manuale adatto al cuoco esperto cos� come al principiante, che esalta l&#39;arte del mangiar bene e ispira la cucina delle famiglie italiane da pi� di un secolo. Un&#39;edizione nuova nella veste ma fedele in tutto e per tutto a quella originale del 1891, pensata per rendere omaggio al padre fondatore della sana cucina di casa nostra, quella della nonna e della mamma, per consegnarla nelle mani delle nuove generazioni. Presentazione di Paolo Piazzesi</p><p>Pellegrino Artusi (Forlimpopoli, 4 agosto 1820 &#x2013; Firenze, 30 marzo 1911) � stato uno scrittore, gastronomo e critico letterario italiano. Figlio di un droghiere benestante, Agostino (detto Burat�l, cio� "piccola anguilla") e di Teresa Giunchi, Pellegrino Artusi nacque in una famiglia numerosa: 12 fratelli; fu chiamato Pellegrino in onore del santo forlivese Pellegrino Laziosi. Come molti ragazzi di buona famiglia, comp� gli studi nel seminario della vicina Bertinoro, nel forlivese. Monumento funebre dell'Artusi nel cimitero di San Miniato al Monte Negli anni tra il 1835 e il 1850, Artusi frequent� ambienti studenteschi bolognesi (in un brano di una sua opera afferma che era iscritto all'universit�). Nella locanda �Tre Re� fece la conoscenza del patriota Felice Orsini, di Meldola, localit� anch'essa presso Forl�. Tornato nel suo paese natale, intraprese la professione del padre, ricavandone un certo profitto, ma la vita della famiglia Artusi venne sconvolta per sempre dall'incursione del 25 gennaio 1851 a Forlimpopoli del brigante Stefano Pelloni, detto il Passatore. Costui prese in ostaggio, nel teatro della citt�, tutte le famiglie pi� in vista, rapinandole una per una. Fra le famiglie rapinate vi fu anche quella di Pellegrino Artusi. Terminata la raccolta del bottino, gli efferati banditi stuprarono alcune donne, e tra queste Gertrude, sorella dell'Artusi che impazzita per lo shock, dovette essere ricoverata in manicomio. L'anno dopo, tutta la famiglia si trasfer� a Firenze. Qui Pellegrino si dedic� all'intermediazione finanziaria; contemporaneamente svilupp� le sue grandi passioni: la letteratura e l'arte della cucina. Sposate le sorelle e morti i genitori, pot� vivere di rendita grazie alle tenute che la famiglia possedeva in Romagna (a Borgo Pieve Sestina di Cesena e Sant'Andrea di Forlimpopoli). Acquist� una casa in piazza D'Azeglio a Firenze, dove tranquillamente condusse la sua esistenza fino al 1911, quando mor�, a 90 anni. Celibe, visse con un domestico del suo paese natale e una cuoca toscana, Marietta. Riposa nel cimitero di San Miniato al Monte. La sua opera pi� famosa � La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene. Il titolo � di chiara matrice positivistica. Artusi, ammiratore del fisiologo monzese Paolo Mantegazza, esaltava il progresso ed era fautore del metodo scientifico, metodo che applic� nel suo libro. Il suo, infatti, pu� essere considerato un manuale "scientificamente testato": ogni ricetta fu il frutto di prove e sperimentazioni.</p><h2>The Mobius Strip Club of Grief</h2><p><p><strong>"Bianca Stone is a brilliant transcriber of&nbsp;her generation's emerging pathology and sensibility." &#x2015;John Ashbery<br><br> A <em>Paris Review</em>&nbsp;Staff Pick and Most Anticipated Book of 2018 at <em>NYLON, Bustle, Autostraddl</em>e, and more.</strong></p><em>The M�bius Strip Club of Grief</em>&nbsp;is a collection of poems that take place in a burlesque purgatory where the living pay&#x2015;dearly, with both money and conscience&#x2015;to watch the dead perform scandalous acts otherwise unseen: &#x201c;$20 for five minutes. I&#x2019;ll hold your hand in my own,&#x201d; one ghost says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you you were good to me.&#x201d; Like Dante before her, Stone positions herself as the living poet passing through and observing the land of the dead. She imagines a feminist Limbo where women run the show and create a space to navigate the difficulties endured in life. With a nod to her grandmother Ruth Stone&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;The Mobius Strip of Grief,&#x201d; Stone creates a labyrinthine underworld as a way to confront and investigate complicated family relationships in the hopes of breaking the never-ending cycle of grief.</p><p>Bianca Stone&nbsp;is a poet and visual artist.

Stone is the child of her muses, Sexton and Emily Dickinson, and it is an odd but delightful union.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Publishers Weekly, Starred Review</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fantastically unsettling and sparks a serious meditation on grief and family, from a distinctly feminine perspective. . . .&nbsp;[Stone] populates her poems with characters that range from Emily Dickinson to her grandmother, and the result is the feeling that we are witnessing a soul&#x2019;s intimate reckoning with life. Many poets have attempted to imagine the afterlife, and Stone&#x2019;s addition to the tradition disrupts it in the best way.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>The Paris Review, Staff Pick</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Meditative and darkly entertaining, vivid and visceral, a little bit out-of-control,&nbsp;<em>The M�bius Strip Club of Grief</em>&nbsp;is filled with tired bodies, bodies with scars, other women poets, and members of Stone&#x2019;s own family &#x2015; including a grandmother who herself is being grieved.

The M�bius strip is easy to construct but for those who enter such a space, escape is impossible&#x2015;a situation readers may find themselves in when they start reading these stellar poems.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Signature Reads</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bianca Stone&#x2019;s lyricism outright rejects the Wordsworthian definition, 'emotion recollected in tranquility'; there is nothing tranquil about these poems or the state in which they were written.

This is an updated and expanded edition of an up-to-now unavailable collection of comics adaptations of the horror master's craft. Lovecraft is a sort of pulpier, purpler Edgar Allan Poe, his stories taking place in a gothic New England landscape. Like all the great spine-tinglers, H.P. likes to leave his monsters up to the imagination, but the works in this collection are fairly dripping with tentacles, specters and monstrous visages. Simon Gane's intense, sometimes overly busy, illustration of "The Shadow Over Innsmouth" portrays Lovecraft's classic beast, Great Cthulu, as a scaly minotaur with a head writhing with suckers. Pedro Lopez's film noiresque vision of "Dreams of the Witch House" has fewer monsters, but still manages to throw in a few tentacles. Even Kevin Atkinson's appropriately cartoonlike illustrations of "Sweet Ermengarde"&#x2014;one of Lovecraft's few works that doesn't mention monsters at all (other than the human sort)&#x2014;has creepy crawlies in the wings.

Now What?"<br><br></b> The time we&#x2019;ve been thrown into is one of alarming and bewildering change&#x2014;the breakup of the post-1945 global order, a multispecies mass extinction, and the beginning of the end of civilization as we know it. Not one of us is innocent, not one of us is safe. The world groans under the weight of seven billion humans; every new birth adds another mouth hungry for food, another life greedy for energy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all see what&#x2019;s happening, we read it in the headlines every day, but seeing isn&#x2019;t believing, and believing isn&#x2019;t accepting. We respond according to our prejudices, acting out of instinct, reflex, and training. Right-wing denialists insist that climate change isn&#x2019;t happening, or that it&#x2019;s not caused by humans, or that the real problem is terrorism or refugees, while left-wing denialists insist that the problems are fixable, under our control, merely a matter of political will. Accelerationists argue that more technology is the answer. Incrementalists tell us to keep trusting the same institutions and leaders that have been failing us for decades. Activists say we have to fight, even if we&#x2019;re sure to lose.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, as the gap between the future we&#x2019;re entering and the future we once imagined grows ever wider, nihilism takes root in the shadow of our fear: if all is already lost, nothing matters anyway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can feel this nihilism in TV shows like <i>The Walking Dead </i>and <i>Game of Thrones</i>, and you can see it in the pull to nationalism, sectarianism, war, and racial hatred. We saw it in the election of Donald Trump. Nihilism defines our current moment, though in truth it&#x2019;s nothing new. The Western world has been grappling with radical nihilism since at least the seventeenth century, when scientific insights into human behavior began to undermine religious belief. Philosophers have struggled since then to fill the gap between fact and meaning: Kant tried to reconcile empiricist determinism with God and Reason; Bergson and Peirce worked to merge Darwinian evolution and human creativity; more recent thinkers glean the stripped furrows neuroscience has left to logic and language.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientific materialism, taken to its extreme, threatens us with meaninglessness; if consciousness is reducible to the brain and our actions are determined not by will but by causes, then our values and beliefs are merely rationalizations for the things we were going to do anyway. Most people find this view of human life repugnant, if not incomprehensible.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her book of essays <i>The Givenness of Things</i>, Marilynne Robinson rejects the materialist view of consciousness, arguing for the existence of the human soul by insisting that the soul&#x2019;s metaphysical character makes it impervious to materialist arguments. The soul, writes Robinson, is an intuition that &#x201c;cannot be dispelled by proving the soul&#x2019;s physicality, from which it is aloof by definition. And on these same grounds, its nonphysicality is no proof of its nonexistence.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biologist E. O. Wilson spins the problem differently: &#x201c;Does free will exist?&#x201d; he asks in <i>The Meaning of Human Existence</i>. &#x201c;Yes, if not in ultimate reality, then at least in the operational sense necessary for sanity and thereby for the perpetuation of the human species.&#x201d; Robinson offers an appeal to ignorance; Wilson, an appeal to consequences; both arguments are fallacious.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet as Wilson suggests, our dogged insistence on free agency makes a kind of evolutionary sense. Indeed, humanity&#x2019;s keenest evolutionary advantage has been its drive to create collective meaning. That drive is as ingenious as it is relentless, and it can find a way to make sense of despair, depression, catastrophe, genocide, war, disaster, plagues, and even the humiliations of science.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our drive to make meaning is powerful enough even to turn nihilism against itself. As Friedrich Nietzsche, one of Western philosophy&#x2019;s most incisive diagnosticians of nihilism, wrote near the end of the nineteenth century: &#x201c;Man will sooner will nothingness than not will.&#x201d; This dense aphorism builds on one of the thoughts at the core of Nietzsche&#x2019;s philosophy, today so widely accepted as to be almost unrecognizable, that human beings make their own meaning out of life.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this view, there is no ultimate, transcendent moral truth. As Nietzsche put it in an early essay, &#x201c;On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense,&#x201d; truth is no more than a &#x201c;mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.&#x201d; If we can stomach the moral vertigo this idea might induce, we can also see how it&#x2019;s not necessarily nihilistic but, in the right light, a testament to human resilience.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The human ability to make meaning is so versatile, so powerful, that it can make almost any existence tolerable, even a life of unending suffering, so long as that life is woven into a bigger story that makes it meaningful. Humans have survived and thrived in some of the most inhospitable environments on Earth, from the deserts of Arabia to the ice fields of the Arctic, because of this ability to organize collective life around symbolic constellations of meaning: <i>anirniit</i>, capital, jihad. &#x201c;If we have our own why in life,&#x201d; Nietzsche wrote, &#x201c;we shall get along with almost any how.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he wrote &#x201c;Man will sooner will nothingness than not will,&#x201d; Nietzsche was exposing the destructive side of humanity&#x2019;s meaning-making drive. That drive is so powerful, Nietzsche&#x2019;s saying, that when forced to the precipice of nihilism, we would choose meaningful self-annihilation over meaningless bare life. This insight was horrifically borne out in the G�tterd�mmerung of Nazi Germany, just as it&#x2019;s being borne out today in every new suicide attack by jihadi terrorists&#x2014;even as it&#x2019;s being borne out here at home in Trump&#x2019;s willfully destructive politics of rage. We risk it when we stumble toward another thoughtless war, asking young men and women to throw their lives away so we might continue believing America means something. As a character in Don DeLillo&#x2019;s novel <i>White Noise </i>remarks: &#x201c;War is the form nostalgia takes when men are hard-pressed to say something good about their country.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nietzsche wasn&#x2019;t himself a nihilist. He developed his idea of truth as a &#x201c;mobile army of metaphors&#x201d; into a more complex philosophy of perspectivism, which conceived of subjective truth as a variety of constructions arising out of particular perspectives on objective reality. The more perspectives we learn to see from, the more truth we have access to. This is different from relativism, with which it&#x2019;s often confused, which says that all truth is relative and there is no objective reality. Fundamentally, Nietzsche was an empiricist who believed that beyond all of our interpretations there was, at last, something we can call the world&#x2014;even if we can never quite apprehend it objectively. &#x201c;Even great spirits have only their five fingers breadth of experience,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;Just beyond it their thinking ceases and their endless empty space and stupidity begins.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nietzsche&#x2019;s positive philosophical project, what he called his &#x201c;gay science,&#x201d; was to create the conditions for the possibility of a human being who could comprehend the meaninglessness of our drive to make meaning, yet nonetheless affirm human existence: a human being who could learn <i>amor fati</i>, the love of one&#x2019;s fate.1 This was his much-misunderstood idea of the &#x201c;overman.&#x201d; Nietzsche labored mightily to create this new human ideal for philosophy because he needed it so badly himself. A gloomy, oversensitive pessimist and self-declared decadent who eventually went mad, he struggled all his life to convince himself that his life was worth living.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, as every hour brings new alarms of war and climate disaster, we might wish we could take Nietzsche&#x2019;s place. He had to cope only with the death of God, after all, while we must come to terms with the death of our whole world. Peril lurks on every side, from the delusions of hope to the fury of reaction, from the despondency of hopelessness to the promise of destruction.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stand today on a precipice of annihilation that Nietzsche could not have even imagined. There is little reason to presume that we&#x2019;ll be able to slow down global warming before we pass a tipping point. We&#x2019;ve already exceeded 1.5� Celsius above preindustrial temperatures and there&#x2019;s more warming baked in.2 The West Antarctic ice sheet is collapsing, Greenland is melting, permafrost across the world is liquefying, and methane has been detected leaking from sea floors and Siberian craters: it&#x2019;s probably already too late to stop these feedbacks, which means it&#x2019;s probably already too late to stop apocalyptic planetary warming. Meanwhile the world slides into hate-filled, bloody havoc, like the last act of a particularly ugly Shakespearean tragedy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accepting our situation could easily be confused with nihilism. In a nation founded on hope, built with &#x201c;can do&#x201d; Yankee grit, and bedazzled by its own technological wizardry, the very idea that something might be beyond our power or that humans have intrinsic limits verges on blasphemy. Right and left, millions of Americans believe that every problem has a solution; suggesting otherwise stirs a deep and hostile resistance. It&#x2019;s not so much that accepting the truth of our situation means thinking the wrong thought, but rather thinking the unthinkable.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it&#x2019;s at just this moment of crisis that our human drive to make meaning reappears as our only salvation . . . if we&#x2019;re willing to reflect consciously on the ways we make life meaningful&#x2014;on how we decide what is good, what our goals are, what&#x2019;s worth living or dying for, and what we do every day, day to day, and how we do it. Because if it&#x2019;s true that we make our lives meaningful ourselves and not through revealed wisdom handed down by God or the Market or History, then it&#x2019;s also true that we hold within ourselves the power to change our lives&#x2014;wholly, utterly&#x2014;by changing what our lives mean. Our drive to make meaning is more powerful than oil, the atom, and the market, and it&#x2019;s up to us to harness that power to secure the future of the human species.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can&#x2019;t do it by clinging to the progressivist, profit-seeking, technology-can-fix-it ideology of fossil-fueled capitalism. We can&#x2019;t do it by trying to control the future. We need to learn to let our current civilization die, to accept our mortality, and to practice humility. We need to work together to transform a global order of meaning focused on accumulation into a new order of meaning that knows the value of limits, transience, and restraint.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most important, we need to give up defending and protecting <i>our </i>truth, <i>our </i>perspective, <i>our </i>Western values, and understand that truth is found not in one perspective but in its multiplication, not in one point of view but in the aggregate, not in opposition but in the whole. We need to learn to see not just with Western eyes but with Islamic eyes and Inuit eyes, not just with human eyes but with golden-cheeked warbler eyes, coho salmon eyes, and polar bear eyes, and not even just with eyes but with the wild, barely articulate being of clouds and seas and rocks and trees and stars.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were born on the eve of what may be the human world&#x2019;s greatest catastrophe. None of us chose this, not deliberately. None of us can choose to avoid it, either. Some of us may even live through it. What meaning we pass on to the future will depend on how well we remember those who have come before us, how wisely and how gently we&#x2019;re able to shed the ruinous way of life that&#x2019;s destroying us today, and how consciously we&#x2019;re able to affirm our role as creators of our fated future.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accepting the fatality of our situation isn&#x2019;t nihilism, but rather the necessary first step in forging a new way of life. Between self-destruction and giving up, between willing nothingness and not willing, there is another choice: willing our fate. Conscious self-creation. We owe it to the generations whose futures we&#x2019;ve burned and wasted to build a bridge, to <i>be </i>a bridge, to connect the diverse human traditions of meaning-making in our past to those survivors, the children of the Anthropocene, who will build a new world among our ruins.</p><h2>The Dictionary of Strum &amp; Picking Patterns</h2><p>(Fretted).

Fat Shame: Stigma and the Fat Body in American Culture explores this arc, from veneration to shame, examining the historic roots of our contemporary anxiety about fatness. Tracing the cultural denigration of fatness to the mid 19th century, Amy Farrell argues that the stigma associated with a fat body preceded any health concerns about a large body size. Firmly in place by the time the diet industry began to flourish in the 1920s, the development of fat stigma was related not only to cultural anxieties that emerged during the modern period related to consumer excess, but, even more profoundly, to prevailing ideas about race, civilization and evolution. For 19th and early 20th century thinkers, fatness was a key marker of inferiority, of an uncivilized, barbaric, and primitive body. This idea&#x2014;that fatness is a sign of a primitive person&#x2014;endures today, fueling both our $60 billion &#x201c;war on fat&#x201d; and our cultural distress over the &#x201c;obesity epidemic.&#x201d;</p><p>Farrell draws on a wide array of sources, including political cartoons, popular literature, postcards, advertisements, and physicians&#x2019; manuals, to explore the link between our historic denigration of fatness and our contemporary concern over obesity. Her work sheds particular light on feminisms&#x2019; fraught relationship to fatness. From the white suffragists of the early 20th century to contemporary public figures like Oprah Winfrey, Monica Lewinsky, and even the Obama family, Farrell explores the ways that those who seek to shed stigmatized identities&#x2014;whether of gender, race, ethnicity or class&#x2014;often take part in weight reduction schemes and fat mockery in order to validate themselves as &#x201c;civilized.&#x201d; In sharp contrast to these narratives of fat shame are the ideas of contemporary fat activists, whose articulation of a new vision of the body Farrell explores in depth. This book is significant for anyone concerned about the contemporary &#x201c;war on fat&#x201d; and the ways that notions of the &#x201c;civilized body&#x201d; continue to legitimate discrimination and cultural oppression.</p></p><p><b>Amy Farrell</b> is Professor of American Studies and Women&#x2019;s and Gender Studies at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA.

She lives in Carlisle with her husband and two children."An eye-opening history about how fatness obtained its stigma in the US. Provocative and illuminating, Farrell unearths fats associations with whiteness, citizenship, feminism, and civilization. Fat Shame will interest scholars of the history and sociology of body politics and those involved in projects of the self, as well as readers who can't help but wonder, &amp; When did we start hating fatness? And why? Farrell has penned a new classic." (Kathleen LeBesco,author of Revolting Bodies? The Struggle to Redefine Fat Identity)<br><br>"Farrell's explorations of fat primitivism in mainstream and feminist cultures are invaluable to understanding the contemporary stigmatization of fat that has become nearly ubiquitous in America today...a soon-to-be classic text in the field of Fat Studies." (Deborah McPhail,Teachers College Record)<br><br>"As part of an actual campaign against weightism, as opposed to Colbert's satirical one, Fat Shame allows us to see how discrimination against fat people became a central feature of American life. Armed with this history, we can better imagine a day when the declaration Farrell made on The Colbert ReportI like the word 'fat'"won't be greeted with laughter." (<i>Bitch Magazine</i>)<br><br>"Farrell's Fat Shame: Stigma and the Fat Body in American Culture [is] an exciting and much-needed addition to fat studies. Carefully researched and well written, Farrell's book investigates the history of fat stigma in the United States, arguing that negative associations with fat existed long before weight became inextricably tied to notions of health." (Anna E. Ward <i>American Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"Fat Shamecan serve as a go to" resource for historical examples of discrimination against fatness. The book appears especially relevant for the fields of sociology, women's studies, or history and could readily serve as an additional resource for course work focused on multiculturalism, obesity, weight management, or body image." (Jill Salsman <i>PsycCRITIQUES</i>)<br><br>"Overall, this is a very interesting book that is easy to read and engage with. Farrell's use of visual information (showing some of the cartoons, post cards, and posters that she discusses in text) is compelling and adds to her arguments" (<i>Metapsychology Online Reviews</i>)<br><br>"In this groundbreaking and fascinating text, Farrell repositions the fat body within a political framework...a must-read for feminists, body theorists, and anyone interested in understanding our cultural obsession with fat" (Amanda Cosco <i>Women's Post</i>)<br><br>"[Farrell's] historical account of shifting social response to overweight people is interesting...[her] observation about stigma related to overweight people is correct." (S.K. Hall <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Amy Erdman Farrell offers a wide-ranging and significant contribution to the relatively new but now substantial contribution on the history of the body." (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"In this bold and powerful book, Amy Farrell uncovers the history, meanings, and consequences of fat stigma. With passion, insight, and eloquence, she condemns the many institutions that denigrate fat people, from the medical establishment and diet industry to the popular culture. Fat Shame challenges Americans of all sizes to accept each other without judgment."

Will be shipped from US.</p><p><p><em>From one of the greatest rock guitarists of our era comes a memoir that redefines sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll</em></p><p>He was born in England but reared in L.A., surrounded by the leading artists of the day amidst the vibrant hotbed of music and culture that was the early seventies. Slash spent his adolescence on the streets of Hollywood, discovering drugs, drinking, rock music, and girls, all while achieving notable status as a BMX rider. But everything changed in his world the day he first held the beat-up one-string guitar his grandmother had discarded in a closet.</p><p>The instrument became his voice and it triggered a lifelong passion that made everything else irrelevant. As soon as he could string chords and a solo together, Slash wanted to be in a band and sought out friends with similar interests. His closest friend, Steven Adler, proved to be a conspirator for the long haul. As hairmetal bands exploded onto the L.A. scene and topped the charts, Slash sought his niche and a band that suited his raw and gritty sensibility.</p><p>He found salvation in the form of four young men of equal mind: Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Steven Adler, and Duff McKagan. Together they became Guns N' Roses, one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands of all time. Dirty, volatile, and as authentic as the streets that weaned them, they fought their way to the top with groundbreaking albums such as the iconic <em>Appetite for Destruction</em> and <em>Use Your Illusion I</em> and <em>II</em>.</p><p>Here, for the first time ever, Slash tells the tale that has yet to be told from the inside: how the band came together, how they wrote the music that defined an era, how they survived insane, never-ending tours, how they survived themselves, and, ultimately, how it all fell apart. This is a window onto the world of the notoriously private guitarist and a seat on the roller-coaster ride that was one of history's greatest rock 'n' roll machines, always on the edge of self-destruction, even at the pinnacle of its success. This is a candid recollection and reflection of Slash's friendships past and present, from easygoing Izzy to ever-steady Duff to wild-child Steven and complicated Axl.</p><p>It is also an intensely personal account of struggle and triumph: as Guns N' Roses journeyed to the top, Slash battled his demons, escaping the overwhelming reality with women, heroin, coke, crack, vodka, and whatever else came along.</p><p>He survived it all: lawsuits, rehab, riots, notoriety, debauchery, and destruction, and ultimately found his creative evolution. From Slash's Snakepit to his current band, the massively successful Velvet Revolver,Slash found an even keel by sticking to his guns. </p><p><em>Slash</em> is everything the man, the myth, the legend, inspires: it's funny, honest, inspiring, jaw-dropping . . . and, in a word, excessive.</p><p>Slash, Velvet Revolver founding member and guitarist, lives in California with his wife, Perla, and their two children.</p><br><br><p>Anthony Bozza is the author of four <em>New York Times</em> Bestsellers, including <em>Whatever You Say I Am: The Life and Times of Eminem, Slash</em>, co-written with Slash and the #1 bestselling <em>Too Fat to Fish,</em> co-written with Artie Lange.

Every evening throngs of soldiers, sailors, and Marines strolled along the seawall, basking in the warm sun and soft gulf breezes. Red, pink, and white oleanders bloomed in all their glory, sea gulls squawked overhead, and gentle waves swished over sandy beaches. It was paradise on earth.<br><br>Small wonder that German U-boat commanders couldn't believe their eyes when they stealthily entered the Gulf of Mexico that year. All navigational lights glowed, and towns and cities along the coast shone brightly, illuminating every American ship traveling by. On Galveston Island the summer tourist season had just begun when Harro Schacht, commander of U-507, sailed up to the mouth of the Mississippi River and blew up eight ships. <br><br>Catching Americans totally unprepared for a Gulf attack, twenty-four German submarines entered the Gulf of Mexico between 1942 and 1943 and attacked both American and Allied ships, sinking fifty-six merchant ships and damaging fourteen more. In May, 1942 alone, the blitz of the "Gulf Sea Frontier" gave German U-boats their greatest victories to that date in the war. From then until peace in 1944, Allied shipping in the Gulf sailed freely, secure from attack--but not until this surprising onslaught raised national patriotism to new heights and brought the war so close to home.<br><br>Based on interviews with U.S. Navy, Merchant Marine, and German U-boat veterans, translated war diaries, and declassified military documents, Torpedoes in the Gulf tells a fascinating personal story with two sides. Readers will marvel at behind-the-scenes accounts of German U-boat spy maneuvers and as Galvestonians, fearing for their lives, raced to fortify their island, convinced at last that they were truly at war.<br><br></p><p>Melanie Wiggins is a freelance writer living in Galveston.

He projected to do this with J. A. Alexander in the 1850s. When the early death of Alexander prevented the completion of the series, the individual volumes were quickly prized in their own right and went through many editions on both sides of the Atlantic.<br><br>The qualities which have given Charles Hodge s commentaries such a wide and enduring market are readily to be seen. In the first place they are singularly clear. The technicalities of critical opinion, which soon cause a volume to become dated, are not to be found in his pages. His aim was to produce commentaries which learned and unlearned alike could consult with profit. Believing that he was dealing with the words of the Holy Spirit he endeavoured to set out both what those words contain and the effects which their truth should have upon the conscience and life.</p><p>Scholar, educator, churchman, and distinguished American Presbyterian systematic theologian of the nineteenth century, Charles Hodge was born in Philadelphia in 1797. Following his father s untimely death a few years after he was born, Charles and his brother were raised by their godly widowed mother. In 1812 Hodge s mother moved the family to Princeton in hope of matriculating her sons at Princeton College.<br><br>Charles Hodge graduated from Princeton College in 1815. During the 1814-15 school year a revival broke out on the college campus: Charles was one of a number of students converted during this time of spiritual refreshing. At the encouragement of Archibald Alexander, he enrolled at Princeton Theological Seminary, graduating with the class of 1819.<br><br>Ordained in 1821, his scholarly gifts led to an appointment by his denomination in 1822 to serve as the seminary s third faculty member. As Professor of Oriental and Biblical Literature, Hodge s primary responsibility was instruction in biblical languages, hermeneutics, biblical criticism, and study of Old Testament texts. During 1826-28, he travelled to Europe to study with the leading European biblical and theological scholars. Hodge focused his studies on theology and biblical interpretation, with additional concentration in Semitic and cognate languages. His studies in Europe made him one of the leading Hebraists teaching in an American theological institution in the early nineteenth century. In the coming decade, Hodge would be assisted by the linguistic talent and philological expertise of Joseph Addison Alexander.<br><br>With Addison s arrival, Hodge concentrated his labours on New Testament texts and studies, serving as Professor of Exegetical and Didactic Theology from 1840 to 1854. From 1854 until his death in 1878, he served as Professor of Exegetical, Didactic, and Polemic Theology.<br><br>During his half-century tenure at Princeton, Charles Hodge held several chairs, but is probably best remembered for the reputation he established as Professor of Systematic Theology. A stout Calvinist with a deep love for the Reformed confessions, his literary labours often involved a polemical thrust, as he sought to defend and expound the Reformed theology of the Protestant Reformation, and the teachings of the Westminster Confession and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, as received and adopted by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.<br><br>A prolific author, Hodge served for many years as editor of the seminary journal, Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review. Under his editorship, it became the leading theological journal of the nineteenth century: Hodge s personal contributions included articles on biblical studies, spirituality, church history and historical theology, ecclesiological issues, philosophy, politics, slavery, abolition and the Civil War. An active churchman, he was at the forefront of ecclesiastical debates and discussion. In addition to articles and essays, Hodge published commentaries on Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Ephesians. A major historical work in defence of old-school Presbyterian doctrine and practice, The Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, appeared in 1840. His popular work on piety, The Way of Life, was published in 1841. His three-volume magnum opus, Systematic Theology, was published in 1872-73, and confirmed him as the outstanding Calvinistic systematic theologian of the nineteenth century. Additional publications on the relationship between Christianity and science, and a collection of essays delivered at the Sabbath Afternoon Conferences (published by the Trust as Princeton Sermons), served to further confirm the breadth of his academic competency and the depth of his Christian piety.</p><h2>D.O.M.: Rediscovering Brazilian Ingredients</h2><p>"<p><b>"Whenever I see that Dos Equis commercial &#x2013; &#x2018;the most interesting man in the world&#x2019; &#x2013; I always think, no, that&#x2019;s not true.

He knew perfectly well what Antipater was planning to do, but he couldn&#x2019;t resist a paradoxical turn of phrase. Puzzles were my father&#x2019;s passion&#x2014;and solving them his profession. He called himself Finder, because men hired him to find the truth.<br>Not surprisingly, old Antipater answered with a poem made up on the spot; for yes, the Antipater of whom I speak was <i>the</i> Antipater of Sidon&#x2014;one of the most celebrated poets in the world, famed not only for the elegance of his verses but for the almost magical way he could produce them impromptu, as if drawn from the aether. His poem was in Greek, of course:<br><i>&#x201c;I died on my birthday, so I must leave Rome.</i><br><i>Now your son has his birthday&#x2014;is it time to leave home?&#x201d;</i><br>Antipater&#x2019;s question, like my father&#x2019;s, was merely rhetorical. For days the old poet and I had been making preparations to leave Rome together on this day. He gave me a smile. &#x201c;It does seem unfair, my boy, that your birthday should be overshadowed by my funeral.&#x201d;<br>I resisted the urge to correct him. Despite his lingering habit of addressing me as a boy, I was in fact a man, and had been so for exactly a year, since I put on my manly toga when I turned seventeen. &#x201c;What better way to celebrate my birthday, Teacher, than to set out on a journey such as most people can only dream of?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well put!&#x201d; Antipater squeezed my shoulder. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not every young man who can look forward to seeing with his own eyes the greatest monuments ever built by mankind, and in the company of mankind&#x2019;s greatest poet.&#x201d; Antipater had never been modest. Now that he was dead, I suppose he had no reason to be.<br>&#x201c;And it&#x2019;s not every man who has the privilege of gazing upon his own funeral stele,&#x201d; my father said, indicating with a wave of his hand the object of which he spoke.<br>The three of us stood in the garden of my father&#x2019;s house on the Esquiline Hill. The sky was cloudless and the air was warm for the month of Martius. In front of us&#x2014;delivered only moments before from the sculptor&#x2019;s workshop&#x2014;stood a riddle in marble. It was a funeral stele for a man who was not dead. The rectangular tablet was elegantly carved and brightly painted, and only about a foot tall. Later it would be placed atop the sepulcher intended for the dead man&#x2019;s ashes, but for now it was propped atop the crate in which it had been delivered.<br>Antipater nodded thoughtfully. &#x201c;And not every man has the opportunity to design his own monument, as I have. You don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s <i>too</i> irreverent, do you, Finder? I mean, we don&#x2019;t want anyone to look at this stele and realize it&#x2019;s a hoax. If anyone should surmise that I&#x2019;ve faked my own death&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stop worrying, old friend. Everything is going as we planned. Five days ago I entered your death in the register at the Temple of Libitina. Thanks to the rich matrons who send a slave to check the lists several times a day, word of your demise spread across Rome in a matter of hours. People assumed that your old friend and patron Quintus Lutatius Catulus must be in possession of your remains and in charge of the funeral arrangements. There was disbelief when it was discovered that a citizen as humble as myself had been named executor in your will, and that your remains were to be displayed in the vestibule of my house. But so it was. I summoned the undertakers to wash and perfume the body, purchased flowers, cypress sprigs, incense, and a very elegant bier&#x2014;your will provided for all necessary expenses&#x2014;and then I put your corpse on display in the vestibule. And what a turnout you&#x2019;ve received! All the poets and half the politicians in Rome have come to pay their respects.&#x201d;<br>Antipater flashed a wry smile. &#x201c;My demise has allowed you to make the acquaintance of the best people in Rome, Finder&#x2014;just the sort who are always getting dragged into court for murdering each other. I daresay this could prove a windfall for you&#x2014;meeting so many potential new clients!&#x201d;<br>My father nodded. &#x201c;Everyone has come to have a look, it seems&#x2014;except Catulus. Do you imagine your patron is sulking, because the will didn&#x2019;t name him as executor?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;More likely he&#x2019;s been holding off, waiting until today to pay his respects&#x2014;the day of the funeral&#x2014;so that his visit will be as conspicuous as possible. Catulus may have the soul of a poet, but he has the instincts of a politician&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Antipater fell silent at the sound of a knock at the front door.<br>&#x201c;Another caller. I shall disappear at once.&#x201d; Antipater hurried to the concealed door that gave access to a narrow chamber next to the vestibule, where a tiny crack in the wall served as a peephole and allowed him to observe all that transpired.<br>A moment later, my father&#x2019;s doorkeeper&#x2014;the only slave he owned at that time&#x2014;appeared in the garden.<br>&#x201c;You have a visitor, Master,&#x201d; Damon wheezed. The constant flood of callers was running the poor old fellow ragged. He cleared his throat and I saw him concentrate, determined to get the name right. &#x201c;Lintus Quitatius Catulus, former consul of the Republic, has come to pay his respects to the deceased.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Quintus Lutatius Catulus, I think you mean,&#x201d; said my father indulgently. &#x201c;Come, son, let us greet the consul.&#x201d;<br>The man in the vestibule was perhaps sixty years old. Like my father and me, he was dressed in a black toga, but his was embroidered with a purple band that marked his status as a senator. Ten years ago Catulus had served as consul and commander of the legions; it was his army that annihilated the Cimbri at the battle of the Raudine Plain. But Catulus was also a man of culture and learning, and was said to have a sensitive nature. He stood stiffly upright before the funeral bier with his hands crossed before him.<br>My father introduced himself, and me as well, but Catulus hardly seemed to notice. &#x201c;Your distinguished presence graces my home, Consul, though I regret the sadness of the occasion. Did you come alone?&#x201d;<br>Catulus raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Of course not. I left my retinue outside, so that I could spend a moment alone with my old friend&#x2014;face-to-face, so to speak. But alas, his face is covered.&#x201d; Catulus gestured to the mask, made of wax, which concealed the face of the corpse. &#x201c;Is it true that his features were damaged by the fall?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid so,&#x201d; said my father. &#x201c;The undertakers did what they could to make him presentable, but the damage was such that I decided it was preferable to conceal the injuries. Normally, a death mask is made from the direct impression of the face in repose. But in this case, I hired a sculptor to create the likeness. The mask will be used in the funeral procession, as usual, but until then I&#x2019;ve placed it over his face. I think the sculptor did a very good job, don&#x2019;t you? It really does look like Antipater, lying there with his eyes shut, as if he slept. Still, if you wish to gaze upon his face....&#x201d;<br>Catulus nodded grimly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a military man, Finder. I&#x2019;ve seen the most terrible things that can be done to human flesh. Show me.&#x201d;<br>My father stepped to the bier and lifted the death mask.<br>The staid consul&#x2019;s abrupt, girlish shriek, stifled by a fist to his mouth, was so incongruous that I almost laughed out loud. Behind the wall, I heard a noise like loose plaster falling, and imagined Antipater shaking with mirth.<br>Catulus glanced at the wall. My father shrugged and looked embarrassed, as if to apologize for the presence of rats.<br>&#x201c;But how could a mere fall have resulted in such terrible disfigurement?&#x201d; Catulus kept his fist pressed to his mouth. He looked a bit green.<br>&#x201c;It was a long fall,&#x201d; explained my father, &#x201c;from the top floor of an apartment in the Subura, five stories up. He landed on his head. As I say, the undertakers did what they could&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I understand. Replace the mask, please.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, Consul.&#x201d;<br>Not for the first time, I wondered about the true identity of the corpse upon the bier. My father had declined to tell me, following his long-standing practice of keeping to himself any aspect of his work that he deemed unnecessary for me to know. When I turned seventeen, I had thought my father might see fit to share all his secrets with me, but if anything, he had become more guarded than ever during the last year. I knew that something very dangerous must be afoot in Rome, for Antipater to fake his own death, and for my father to assist him in such a wild scheme, but regarding the details, I had been kept in the dark.<br>The elderly body on the bier was apparently an excellent match for Antipater; not one of the many visitors had expressed the least doubt. Of course, the only parts of the corpse that were visible were the long white hair and beard and the wrinkled, age-spotted hands crossed over the chest, the rest being covered by one of Antipater&#x2019;s favorite garments and by the mask. The man truly had died from a fall in the Subura, just as my father described, cracking his skull and shattering his face. Had he been a slave, discreetly acquired from his owner? Or some lowlife criminal whom no one cared to claim? Or simply some ancient citizen of the Subura without family or friends to mourn him? Whoever he was, he had died at the right time and in such a manner that he could be passed off as Antipater. In a way, my father had done the poor fellow a favor; the dead man had been mourned by the best people in Rome and was about to receive funeral rites far above his station.<br>&amp;...</p><h2>Outward Sign and Inward Grace</h2><p>Outward Sign and Inward Grace [Paperback] [Jan 31, 1991] Staples, Rob L.</p><p></p><h2>Happiness: Lessons from a New Science</h2><p>There is a paradox at the heart of our lives. We all want more money, but as societies become richer, they do not become happier. This is not speculation: It's the story told by countless pieces of scientific research. We now have sophisticated ways of measuring how happy people are, and all the evidence shows that on average people have grown no happier in the last fifty years, even as average incomes have more than doubled.<p>The central question the great economist Richard Layard asks in <b>Happiness</b> is this: If we really wanted to be happier, what would we do differently? First we'd have to see clearly what conditions generate happiness and then bend all our efforts toward producing them. That is what this book is about-the causes of happiness and the means we have to effect it.</p><p>Until recently there was too little evidence to give a good answer to this essential question, but, Layard shows us, thanks to the integrated insights of psychology, sociology, applied economics, and other fields, we can now reach some firm conclusions, conclusions that will surprise you. <b>Happiness</b> is an illuminating road map, grounded in hard research, to a better, happier life for us all.</p></p><p>"Impressive . . .

In <i>Reading Comics</i>, critic Douglas Wolk shows us why and how. Wolk illuminates the most dazzling creators of modern comics-from Alan Moore to Alison Bechdel to Chris Ware-and explains their roots, influences, and where they fit into the pantheon of art. As accessible to the hardcore fan as to the curious newcomer, <i>Reading Comics</i> is the first book for people who want to know not just which comics are worth reading, but ways to think and talk and argue about them.</p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, August 2007: With none of the bashful, "comics aren't just for kids any more!" throat-clearing that accompanies most mainstream writing on comics, Douglas Wolk's <i>Reading Comics: How Graphic Novels Work and What They Mean</i> leaps straight into smart, conversational talk about perhaps the liveliest medium going. His enthusiasms and criticisms are infectious and often surprising, and, most refreshingly, he treats the two often warring (or at least mutually ignorant) sides of comics--the superhero tradition and the art comics that have gained highbrow attention lately--without ignoring the differences between them. <i>Reading Comics</i> is an appealingly idiosyncratic tour of many of his favorite artists that doesn't hesitate to criticize some of the most revered names in the business (like Chris Ware and Will Eisner) or investigate some of its most forgotten genre byways (like the '70s series <i>Tomb of Dracula</i>) with serious enthusiasm. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <p> <strong>Questions for Douglas Wolk</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong>What do comics--the writing and the pictures and the narrative combined--give us that other art forms don't? </p><p> <strong>Wolk:</strong> The most important thing comics give us, I think, is drawing that makes a story. What you're seeing when you look at a page of comics, you're not just looking at a bunch of images that represent a plot, you're looking at something that came from somebody's hand--a deliberately distorted world, changing over time, built by a particular artist, line by line. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> There is a great perceived divide in comics, between the superhero tradition and what you call art comics. One of the pleasures of your book is the way you happily work both sides of that divide without fuss. Do you think the divide is valid, or does it melt away the more attention you pay to individual artists? </p><p> <strong>Wolk:</strong> There's definitely a useful distinction to make--art comics are primarily about particular cartoonists' self-expression, and superhero comics are primarily about the characters and their shared fictional history. One's an ethos, the other's a genre. But I don't think individual artists have to stay in one camp or the other, and in any case an ethos and a genre can overlap. You can say that Mark Bagley and Hope Larson belong to totally different schools, but then somebody like Bill Sienkiewicz turns up and makes the idea of a binary opposition look ridiculous. In fact, the best genre comics almost always have a really strong sense of expressive style about them. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> One way you, by necessity, limit the range of your discussion is to leave out the newspaper-strip side of comics history. As someone who came to comics from that side of things, it was a little disconcerting to read a book on American comics that only made a single passing reference to Charles Schulz. What influence do you think newspaper strips have had on the development of art comics especially? </p><p><strong>Wolk:</strong> One of the biggest breakthroughs I had in writing <i>Reading Comics</i> was realizing that not only did I not have to make it comprehensive, it'd be more interesting and useful if it didn't even pretend to be comprehensive! I didn't mention newspaper strips much because they mostly seem to me to be playing a slightly different game from narrative comics--at least, there hasn't been a lot of extended narrative in newspaper strips in a long time. (By their nature, they have to get in and get out in a few lines, and now that they're all postage-stamp-sized, there's really no way they can move a story forward.) What newspaper strips did contribute to art comics was the development of distinctive visual style--the idea that an artist's handiwork was at least as important as a strip's characters--but these days they're so tightly limited by their size and populism and every-third-panel punchlines that they sometimes seem like an arcane kind of microminiature. Everybody loves "Peanuts," but I don't know that there's even room for a new stylist as fresh as Schulz (or George Herriman or Milton Caniff or Winsor McCay) on the newspaper page now. On the other hand, "Calvin &amp; Hobbes" wasn't so long ago. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> And for a reader like me who has pretty much bypassed the superhero tradition and become a Dan Clowes/Charles Burns/Chris Ware fan via Peanuts and literary fiction, where would you recommend I start reading on the superhero side of the divide, which, as you say, has become so self-referential that it can be hard to crack the code? </p><p> <strong>Wolk:</strong> I was talking with some friends recently about the common mistake of recommending Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' <i>Watchmen</i>, as great as it is, as a starting point for superhero comics--as one of them put it, that's like recommending <i>The Seventh Seal</i> as someone's first movie! For pure, unencumbered superhero joycore, I love Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's <i>All-Star Superman</i>--if you've heard of Clark Kent and Lois Lane, you know everything you need to know to enjoy it, and it deepens with repeated reading. Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos's cruelly witty <i>Alias</i>, about a self-loathing ex-superheroine-turned-P.I., has lots of Easter eggs for the continuity-obsessed, but it probably works even better as a stand-alone story. And if you're at all into Victorian literature and/or want to sample Moore's work, the two volumes of <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i> (drawn by Kevin O'Neill) are hugely fun on their own, and also illustrate by analogy the way a lot of the best superhero comics and other pulp art work: providing metaphors to illuminate the central concerns of their moment. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You're as prolific a writer about music as you are about comics. How do you compare writing about the two? </p><p> <strong>Wolk:</strong> They're hard to compare--it feels like different parts of my brain deal with music and comics. I suppose both of them present the risk of paying too much attention to the words and missing the really important stuff. There's also much more of a tradition of music criticism with a strong, personal voice, and a richer shared vocabulary for talking about what's happening in music. ("Musical," for instance, is a perfectly normal word; there's no word that means "comics-ish"...) Right now, people writing about comics (in English, anyway) are still making it up as we go along, which is risky but exciting.</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> I'm a big fan of your little book on James Brown's <i>Live at the Apollo</i>, my favorite so far in that wonderful 33 1/3 series, and one thing that struck me, having read your two books now, is that one, the James Brown book, is super-tight (fitting its subject I guess), aphoristic and efficient, while the other, <i>Reading Comics</i>, seems purposefully loose, willing to take a stroll and maybe not come back. Is that a difference you thought about while writing the two books? </p><p> <strong>Wolk:</strong> It was! I thought of <i>Live at the Apollo</i> as one long essay, a way of diagramming how the 35 minutes of that album exploded outwards in time, and I stole a lot of its tone and technique from George W.S. Trow's tiny fireball of a book <i>In the Context of No Context</i>. I wanted <i>Reading Comics</i> to be more conversational--the idea was to open up as many arguments as I could, to try to broaden the way people talk about comics instead of codifying it. </p><b>Douglas Wolk</b> writes about comics and music for publications including the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Salon</i>, and <i>The Believer</i>.

Her spontaneous, explosive approach to political action has involved jumping over barbed wire, kissing police officers, giving guerilla performances in crowded subway cars, and going on a hunger strike to protest the abuse of prisoners. She&#x2019;s been horse-whipped by police in Sochi, temporarily blinded when officers threw green paint in her eyes, and monitored by the Russian government.

Many of us find the doctrine of the Trinity that God is three persons sharing one nature difficult to get our heads round, and frankly a bit embarrassing. What is more, we seem to get by without thinking about it too deeply. <br> <br>But in reality, the Trinity is at the heart of all that Christians believe. The nature of God as a Trinity gives shape to all Christian truth, and to the gospel that we believe and proclaim. And rather than be a source of embarrassment, properly understood, it should fill us with joy.<br> <br>This book aims to help you see how the Trinity is fantastically good news. Because the trinity means that God is not remote and uninvolved quite the opposite. God sent His Son and His Spirit into our world to draw us into a wonderful relationship with Himself. This is the God who gives meaning and joy to our lives. <br><br>And along the way we discover that the Trinity answers other big questions: How can we know God? What happened at the cross? What does it mean to be human? How can people live together with all their differences? What does mission look like in a fragmented world?<br> <br>Tim Chester will take us deeper into understanding the thrilling triune nature of God. In short accessible chapters he takes us through the Bibles teaching on the Trinity; gives us an overview of the important arguments over the trinity that have taken place throughout Christian history; and lays out the practical implications for our Christian lives.</p><p>Tim Chester is a pastor at Grace Church, Boroughbridge, UK; a faculty member of Crosslands Training; and is the author of over 30 books.

Then ten seconds in a dark alley cost him everything: his friends, his fellow agents, his reputation. Among his super-elite FBI Hostage Rescue Team, Web was the sole survivor of a high-tech, devastating ambush.<b><br><br></b>Now Web is trying to put his life back together and understand what really happened. To get answers, he'll need the help of psychiatrist Claire Daniels and the one other human being who lived through the attack--a ten-year-old boy.

And this time, one of them will become the <i>Last Man Standing</i>.<b><br></b></p><p><i>Last Man Standing</i> has the essential elements of a terrific David Baldacci novel: a tough but tender-hearted hero, dirty dealings in the nation's bureaucracy, and a roller-coaster plot. Web London, a member of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, froze up on a drug raid and thus became the sole survivor of a remote-controlled ambush that killed six of his compatriots. Now the only witness has disappeared and the inside man on the botched raid has gone underground. <p> As a pretty psychiatrist puzzles over the corners of Web's brain that kept him alive, Web himself stays on the move. He's certain that the ambush is connected to the prison escape of a neofascist leader, Ernest B. Free, whom he helped arrest five years earlier, and a series of new murders leads him to a Virginia horse farm and the driving force behind all the carnage. It may seem as though Baldacci gives away the mastermind too soon, but both the bad guys and the good guys are complex enough that there's plenty of punch all the way to the last page. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>David Baldacci is a global #1 bestselling author, and one of the world&#39;s favorite storytellers.

One taste of the beautiful redhead, and he craves more.<br><br>Gwen, an immortal herself, always thought she'd fall for a kind human who wouldn't rouse her darker side. But when Sabin frees her from prison, battling their enemies for the claim to Pandora's box turns out to be nothing compared to the battle Sabin and Gwen will wage against love....<br><br></p><p>Gena is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 25 books.<br><br>Sabin, keeper of the demon of Doubt, stood in the catacombs of an ancient pyramid, panting, sweating, his hands soaked in his enemy's blood, his body cut and bruised as he surveyed the carnage around him. Carnage he'd helped create.<br><br>Torches flickered orange and gold, twining with shadows along the stone walls. Walls that were now spattered with vivid red, dripping... pooling. The sandy floor was thick like paste, wet and colored black. Half an hour ago it had been honey brown, grains sparkling and scattering as they'd marched. Now bodies littered every square inch of the small corridor, the scent of fatality already rising from them.<br><br>Nine of his enemy had survived the attack. They'd already been stripped of their weapons, hustled into a corner and bound with rope. Most trembled in fear. A few had their shoulders squared, their noses in the air, hatred in their eyes, refusing to back down even in defeat. Damned admirable.<br><br>Too bad that bravery had to be quashed.<br><br>Brave men didn't spill their secrets, and Sabin wanted their secrets.<br><br>He was a warrior who did what needed to be done, when it needed to be done, no matter what was required of him. Killing, torturing, seducing. He didn't hesitate to ask his men to do the same, either. With Hunters&#x2014; mortals who'd decided he and his fellow Lords of the Underworld made good whipping boys for the world's evil&#x2014;victory was the only thing that mattered. For only by winning the war could his friends finally know peace. Peace they deserved. Peace he craved for them.<br><br>Shallow, erratic rasps of breath filled Sabin's ears. His, his friends', his enemies'. They'd fought with every ounce of strength they possessed, each of them. It had been a battle of good versus evil, and evil had won. Or rather, what these Hunters considered evil. He and his brothers-by-circumstance thought otherwise.<br><br>Yeah, long ago they'd opened Pandora's box, unleashing the demons from inside. But they had been punished eternally, each warrior cursed by the gods to host one of those vile fiends inside himself. Yeah, they'd once been slaves to their new, demonic halves, destructive and violent, killers without a conscience. But they had control now, human in all the ways that mattered. For the most part.<br><br>Sometimes the demons <em>did </em>fight... <em>did </em>win... <em>did </em>destroy.<br><br>Still. <em>We deserve to live, </em>he thought. Like everyone else, they suffered if their friends were hurt, read books, watched movies, gave to charity. Fell in love. Hunters, though, would never see it that way. They were convinced the world would be a better place without the Lords. A utopia, serene and perfect. They believed every sin ever committed could be laid at a demon's feet. Maybe because they were dumb as shit. Maybe because they hated their lives and were simply looking for someone to blame. Either way, killing them had become the most important mission of Sabin's life. <em>His </em>utopia was a life without <em>them.</em><br><br>Which was why he and the others had relinquished the comforts of their Budapest home to spend the past three weeks searching every godsforsaken pyramid in Egypt for ancient artifacts that would lead to the recovery of Pandora's box&#x2014;the very thing Hunters planned to use to destroy them. Finally, he and his friends had hit the jackpot.<br><br>"Amun," he said, spotting the soldier in a far, dark corner. As usual, man blended perfectly with shadow. Sabin motioned toward the captives with a grim shake of his head. "You know what to do."<br><br>Amun, keeper of Secrets, nodded forbiddingly before striding forward. Silent, always silent, as if afraid the terrible secrets he'd gleaned over the centuries would spill from him if he dared utter a single word.<br><br>Seeing the hulking warrior who'd ripped through their brethren like a knife through silk, the remaining Hunters took a collective step backward. Even the brave ones. Wise of them.<br><br>Amun was tall, leanly muscled, with a stride that was somehow both purposeful and graceful. Purpose without grace would have made him seem normal, like any other soldier. The combination allowed him to exude the kind of quiet savagery usually found in predators used to bringing their prey home between their jaws.<br><br>He reached the Hunters and stopped. Scanned the thinned crowd. Then shoved forward and grabbed the one in the center by the throat, lifting him so that they were eye to eye. The human's legs flailed, his hands clutching Amun's wrists as his skin blanched.<br><br>"Let him go, you filthy demon," one of the Hunters shouted, jerking on his comrade's waist. "You've killed countless innocents, ruined so many lives already!"<br><br>Amun was unmoved. They all were.<br><br>"He's a good man," another cried. "He doesn't deserve to die. Especially at the hands of such evil!"<br><br>Gideon, the blue-haired, kohl-eyed keeper of Lies, was at Amun's side in the next instant, batting the protestors away. "Touch him again, and I'll kiss the hell out of you." He withdrew a pair of serrated knives, still bloody from his most recent clashes.<br><br><em>Kiss </em>equaled <em>beat </em>in Gideon's upside-down world. Or was it <em>kill? </em>Sabin had lost track of Lies's code.<br><br>A moment passed in confused silence, the Hunters trying to figure out what exactly Gideon meant. Before they could decide, Amun's hostage stilled, wilting completely, and Amun dropped him to the ground in a motionless heap.<br><br>Amun remained in place for a long while. No one touched him. Not even the Hunters. They were too preoccupied with reviving their fallen cohort. They didn't know that it was too late, that his brain had been wiped, Amun the new owner of all his deepest secrets. Perhaps even his memories. The warrior had never told Sabin how it worked, and Sabin had never asked.<br><br>Slowly Amun turned, his body stiff. His black gaze met Sabin's for a bleak, tormented moment in which he couldn't mask the pain of having a new voice inside his head. Then he blinked, hiding his pain as he had a thousand times before, and strode to the far wall while Sabin watched, resolute. <em>I will not feel guilty. This has to be done.</em><br><br>The wall looked the same as any other, jagged stones piled on top of each other and rising at a slant, yet Amun placed one hand on the seventh stone down, fingers splayed, then his other hand on the fifth up, fingers closed. Moving in sync, he twisted one wrist to the left, one to the right.<br><br>The stones pivoted with him.<br><br>Sabin observed the proceedings with awe. Never ceased to amaze him, what Amun could learn in a few heartbeats of time.<br><br>Once the stones settled into their new positions, a crack formed in the center of each, branching up, down, aligning with a streak of space Sabin hadn't noticed before. A section of the wall pulled back... back, and finally began to inch to the side. There would be a gaping doorway when it finished, wide enough for an army of hulking beasts like himself.<br><br>As it continued to widen, cool air blustered through the catacombs, causing the torches to sputter and crackle. <em>Hurry, </em>he projected to the stones. Had anything ever moved with such agonizing slowness?<br><br>"Any Hunters waiting on the other side?" he asked, sliding his Sig Sauer from his waist and checking the clip. Three bullets left. He dug a few more from his pocket and reloaded. The custom silencer remained in place.<br><br>Amun nodded and held up seven fingers before standing guard at that ever-widening chasm.<br><br>Seven Hunters against ten Lords. He didn't count Amun because the man would soon be too distracted by the new voice in his head to fight. But gods knew Amun would still (silently) demand to be included in the action. Still. Poor Hunters. They didn't have a chance. "They know we're here?"<br><br>A shake of that dark head.<br><br>No cameras watching their every move, then. Excellent.<br><br>"Seven Hunters is child's play," Lucien, keeper of Death, confirmed as he slumped against the far wall. He was pale, his mismatched eyes bright with... fever? "Go on without me. I'm fading. I'll soon have souls to escort, anyway. And then I'll have to flash our prisoners to the dungeon in Buda."<br><br>Thanks to the demon of Death, Lucien could move from one location to another with only a thought and was often forced to usher the dead into the hereafter. That didn't mean he himself was immune to destruction. Sabin frowned over at him. Studied him. The scars on his face were more pronounced, his nose out of joint. There was a bullet wound in his shoulder, one in his stomach, and from the looks of the crimson stain spreading from his lower back, his kidney.<br><br>"You okay, man?"<br><br>Lucien smiled wryly. "I'll live. Tomorrow, though, I'll probably wish I hadn't. A few organs are shredded."<br><br>Ouch. Been there, had to recover from that. "At least you don't have to regenerate a limb."<br><br>From the corner of his eye, he saw Amun flash hand signs.<br><br>"Not only are there no cameras installed, but they're in a chamber with soundproof walls," Sabin interpreted. "This was an ancient prison and the masters did not want anyone to hear their slaves screaming. The Hunters are completely oblivious to our presence, which should make it easy to ambush them."<br><br>"You don't need me for a simple ambush. I'll stay behind with Lucien," Reyes said, sliding to his ass and propping his back on a stone to hold himself up. Reyes had been paired with the demon of Pain. Physical agony brought him pleasure and being injured actually strengthened him. While fighting. When the fight ended, however, he weakened like anyone else. Right now, he was more battered than the rest of them, with a cheek so swollen his line of vision had to be shit. "Besides, someone needs to guard the prisoners."<br><br>Seven against eight, then. Poor Hunters. Actually, Sabin suspected Reyes wanted to stay behind to guard Lucien's body from the enemy. Lucien could take it with him to the spirit world only when he was strong enough, which he probably wasn't now.<br><br>"Your women are going to give me hell," Sabin muttered. The two had recently fallen in love, and both Anya and Danika had asked only one thing of Sabin before the warriors left for Egypt: bring my man back safely.<br><br>When the boys arrived home in this damaged condition, Danika would shake her head at Sabin in disappointment as she rushed to soothe Reyes and Sabin would feel slimier than the mud on his boots. Anya would shoot him exactly as Lucien had been shot, <em>then </em>comfort Lucien, and Sabin would feel pain. Lots and lots of pain.<br><br>Sighing, Sabin eyed the rest of the warriors, trying to decide who was good to go and who needed to remain behind. Maddox&#x2014;Violence&#x2014;was the fiercest fighter he'd ever known. Right now the warrior was as blood-soaked as Sabin and panting for breath, but he'd already moved beside Amun, ready for action. His woman wasn't going to be any happier with Sabin than the others.<br><br>Slight shift, and the lovely Cameo came into view. She was the keeper of Misery, as well as the only female soldier among them. What she lacked in size she made up for in ferocity. Besides, all she had to do was start talking, all the sorrows of the world in her voice, and humans were likely to kill <em>themselves </em>without her ever having to lay a finger on them. Someone had sliced at her neck, leaving three deep grooves. It didn't seem to slow her down as she finished cleaning her machete and joined Amun and Maddox.<br><br>Another shift. Paris was the keeper of Promiscuity and once upon a time, he'd been the most jovial among them. Now he seemed harder, more restless with every day that passed, though Sabin couldn't fathom what had caused the change. Whatever the reason, he currently loomed in front of the Hunters, huffing and growling and so keyed for war he vibrated with brutal energy. And though there were two gushing holes in his right leg, Sabin didn't think the warrior would be asking to rest anytime soon.<br><br>Beside him was Aeron, Wrath. Only recently had the gods freed him from a curse of bloodlust where no one around him had been safe. He'd lived to hurt, to kill. At moments like these, he still did. Today he'd fought as though that lust still consumed him, hacking at and mauling anyone within his reach. That was good, except...<br><br>How much worse would that bloodlust be when the next fight ended? Sabin feared they would have to summon Legion, the tiny, blood-hungry demon who worshipped Aeron like a god and was the only one who could calm Aeron during his darker moods. Unfortunately, she was currently doing surveillance work for them in hell. Sabin liked to keep up-to-date on Underworld happenings. Knowledge was power and one never knew what one would be able to use.<br><br>Aeron suddenly slammed a fist into a Hunter's temple, sending the human to the floor in an unconscious heap.<br><br>Sabin blinked at him. "What was that for?"<br><br>"He was about to attack."<br><br>Doubtful, but just like that, Paris cut whatever invisible tether had been holding him in place and swooped through the rest of the huddle, methodically punching the Hunters until every single one of them was down.<br><br>"That should keep them calm as Amun for the time being," he rasped darkly.<br><br>Sighing, Sabin switched his attention yet again. There was Strider, Defeat. The man couldn't lose at anything without enduring debilitating pain, so he made sure to win. Always. Which was probably why he was digging a bullet out of his side in preparation for the battle to come. Good. Sabin could always count on him.<br><br>Kane, keeper of Disaster, walked in front of him, ducking as a shower of pebbles fell from the ceiling, plumes of dust spraying in every direction. Several warriors coughed.<br><br>"Uh, Kane," Sabin said. "Why don't you stay here, too? You can help Reyes watch the prisoners." A flimsy excuse and they all knew it.<br><br>There was a pause, the only sound to be heard the scrape of stone against sand as the doorway continued that slow glide. Then Kane gave a clipped nod. He hated being left out, that much Sabin knew, but his presence sometimes caused more problems than it solved. And as always, Sabin placed victory above his friends' feelings. It wasn't something he enjoyed doing, wasn't something he'd do in any other situation. But someone had to act with cold-blooded logic or else they'd always lose.<br><br>With Kane out, that made the coming battle seven against seven. Totally even. Poor Hunters. They still didn't stand a chance. "Anyone else want to stay behind?"<br><br>A chorus of "No" circled the chamber, eagerness dripping from the different timbres. An eagerness Sabin shared.<br><br></p><h2>Romans (Paideia: Commentaries on the New Testament)</h2><p>In this fresh and readable addition to the Paideia series, well-respected New Testament scholar Frank Matera examines cultural context and theological meaning in Romans.

It has become frequent, two or three times a week, at random times: midnight-three a.m.-five in the morning. Here is a high, empty wail that severs Gene from his unconsciousness like sharp teeth. It is the worst sound that Gene can imagine, the sound of a young child dying violently-falling from a building, or caught in some machinery that is tearing an arm off, or being mauled by a predatory animal. No matter how many times he hears it he jolts up with such images playing in his mind, and he always runs, thumping into the child's bedroom to find Frankie sitting up in bed, his eyes closed, his mouth open in an oval like a Christmas caroler. If someone took a picture of him, he would appear to be in a kind of peaceful trance, as if he were waiting to receive a spoonful of ice cream, rather than emitting that horrific sound.<br><br>"Frankie!" Gene will shout, and claps his hands hard in the child's face. The clapping works well. At this, the scream always stops abruptly, and Frankie opens his eyes, blinking at Gene with vague awareness before settling back down into his pillow, nuzzling a little before growing still. He is sound asleep, he is always sound asleep, though even after months Gene can't help leaning down and pressing his ear to the child's chest, to make sure he's still breathing, his heart is still going. It always is.<br><br>There is no explanation that they can find. In the morning, Frankie doesn't remember anything, and on the few occasions that they have managed to wake him in the midst of one of his screaming attacks, he is merely sleepy and irritable. Once, Gene's wife, Karen, shook him and shook him, until finally he opened his eyes groggily. "Honey?" she said. "Honey? Did you have a bad dream?" But Frankie only moaned a little. "No," he said, puzzled and unhappy at being awakened, but nothing more.<br><br>They can find no pattern to it. It can happen any day of the week, any time of the night. It doesn't seem to be associated with diet, or with his activities during the day, and it doesn't stem, as far as they can tell, from any sort of psychological unease. During the day, he seems perfectly normal and happy.<br><br>They have taken him several times to the pediatrician, but the doctor seems to have little of use to say. There is nothing wrong with the child physically, Dr. Banerjee says. She advises that such things were not uncommon for children of Frankie's age group-he is five-and that more often than not, the disturbance simply passes away.<br><br>"He hasn't experienced any kind of emotional trauma, has he?" the doctor says. "Nothing out of the ordinary at home?"<br><br>"No, no," they both murmur, together. They shake their heads, and Dr. Banerjee shrugs. "Parents," she says. "It's probably nothing to worry about." She gives them a brief smile. "As difficult as it is, I'd say that you may just have to weather this out."<br><br>But the doctor has never heard those screams. In the mornings after the "nightmares," as Karen calls them, Gene feels unnerved, edgy. He works as a driver for the United Parcel Service, and as he moves through the day after a screaming attack, there is a barely perceptible hum at the edge of his hearing, an intent, deliberate static sliding along behind him as he wanders through streets and streets in his van. He stops along the side of the road and listens. The shadows of summer leaves tremble murmurously against the windshield, and cars are accelerating on a nearby road. In the treetops, a cicada makes its trembly, pressure-cooker hiss.<br><br>Something bad has been looking for him for a long time, he thinks, and now, at last, it is growing near.<br><br>When he comes home at night everything is normal. They live in an old house in the suburbs of Cleveland, and sometimes after dinner they work together in the small patch of garden out in back of the house- tomatoes, zucchini, string beans, cucumbers-while Frankie plays with Legos in the dirt. Or they take walks around the neighborhood, Frankie riding his bike in front of them, his training wheels squeaking. They gather on the couch and watch cartoons together, or play board games, or draw pictures with crayons. After Frankie is asleep, Karen will sit at the kitchen table and study-she is in nursing school-and Gene will sit outside on the porch, flipping through a newsmagazine or a novel, smoking the cigarettes that he has promised Karen he will give up when he turns thirty-five. He is thirty-four now, and Karen is twenty- seven, and he is aware, more and more frequently, that this is not the life that he deserves. He has been incredibly lucky, he thinks. Blessed, as Gene's favorite cashier at the supermarket always says. "Have a blessed day," she says, when Gene pays the money and she hands him his receipt, and he feels as if she has sprinkled him with her ordinary, gentle beatitude. It reminds him of long ago, when an old nurse had held his hand in the hospital and said that she was praying for him.<br><br>Sitting out in his lawn chair, drawing smoke out of his cigarette, he thinks about that nurse, even though he doesn't want to. He thinks of the way she'd leaned over him and brushed his hair as he stared at her, imprisoned in a full body cast, sweating his way through withdrawal and DTs.<br><br>He had been a different person, back then. A drunk, a monster. At eighteen, he married the girl he'd gotten pregnant, and then had set about slowly, steadily, ruining all their lives. When he'd abandoned them, his wife and son, back in Nebraska, he had been twenty-four, a danger to himself and others. He'd done them a favor by leaving, he thought, though he still feels guilty when he looks back on it. Years later, when he was sober, he even tried to contact them. He wanted to own up to his behavior, to pay the back child support, to apologize. But they were nowhere to be found. Mandy was no longer living in the small Nebraska town where they'd met and married, and there was no forwarding address. Her parents were dead. No one seemed to know where she'd gone.<br><br>Karen didn't know the full story. She had been, to his relief, uncurious about his previous life, though she knew he had some drinking days, some bad times. She knew that he'd been married before, too, though she didn't know the extent of it, didn't know that he had another son, for example, didn't know that he had left them one night, without even packing a bag, just driving off in the car, a flask tucked between his legs, driving east as far as he could go. She didn't know about the car crash, the wreck he should have died in. She didn't know what a bad person he'd been.<br><br>She was a nice lady, Karen. Maybe a little sheltered. And truth to tell, he was ashamed-and even scared-to imagine how she would react to the truth about his past. He didn't know if she would have ever really trusted him if she'd known the full story, and the longer they have known each other the less inclined he has been to reveal it. He'd escaped his old self, he thought, and when Karen got pregnant, shortly before they were married, he told himself that now he had a chance to do things over, to do it better. They had bought the house together, he and Karen, and now Frankie will be in kindergarten in the fall. He has come full circle, has come exactly to the point when his former life with Mandy and his son, DJ, completely fell apart. He looks up as Karen comes to the back door and speaks to him through the screen. "I think it's time for bed, sweetheart," she says, and he shudders off these thoughts, these memories. He smiles.<br><br>He's been in a strange frame of mind lately. The months of regular awakenings have been getting to him, and he has a hard time going back to sleep after an episode with Frankie. When Karen wakes him in the morning, he often feels muffled, sluggish-as if he's hungover. He doesn't hear the alarm clock. When he stumbles out of bed, he finds he has a hard time keeping his moodiness in check. He can feel his temper coiling up inside him.<br><br>He isn't that type of person anymore, and hasn't been for a long while. Still, he can't help but worry. They say that there is a second stretch of craving, which sets in after several years of smooth sailing; five or seven years will pass, and then it will come back without warning. He has been thinking of going to AA meetings again, though he hasn't in some time-not since he met Karen.<br><br>It's not as if he gets trembly every time he passes a liquor store, or even as if he has a problem when he goes out with buddies and spends the evening drinking soda and nonalchoholic beer. No. The trouble comes at night, when he's asleep.<br><br>He has begun to dream of his first son. DJ. Perhaps it is related to his worries about Frankie, but for several nights in a row the image of DJ-age about five-has appeared to him. In the dream, Gene is drunk, and playing hide-and-seek with DJ in the yard behind the Cleveland house where he is now living. There is the thick weeping willow out there, and Gene watches the child appear from behind it and run across the grass, happy, unafraid, the way Frankie would. DJ turns to look over his shoulder and laughs, and Gene stumbles after him, at least a six-pack's worth of good mood, a goofy, drunken dad. It's so real that when he wakes, he still feels intoxicated. It takes him a few minutes to shake it.<br><br>One morning after a particularly vivid version of this dream, Frankie wakes and complains of a funny feeling-"right here"-he says, and points to his forehead. It isn't a headache, he says. "It's like bees!" he says. "Buzzing bees!" He rubs his hand against his brow. "Inside my head." He considers for a moment. "You know how the bees bump against the window when they get in the house and want to get out?" This description pleases him, and he taps his forehead lightly with his fingers, humming, "Zzzzzzz," to demonstrate.<br><br>"Does it hurt?" Karen says.<br><br>"No," Frankie says. "It tickles."<br><br>Karen gives Gene a concerned look. She makes Frankie lie down on the couch, and tells him to close his eyes for a while. After a few minutes, he raises up, smiling, and says that the feeling has gone.<br><br>"Honey, are you sure?" Karen says. She pushes her hair back and slides her palm across his forehead. "He's not hot," she says, and Frankie sits up impatiently, suddenly more interested in something that is happening on the Fuzzy Fieldmouse show, which is playing on the TV in the living room.<br><br>Karen gets out one of her nursing books, and Gene watches her face tighten with concern as she flips slowly through the pages. She is looking at Chapter 3: Neurological System, and Gene observes as she pauses here and there, skimming down a list of symptoms. "We should probably take him back to Dr. Banerjee again," she says. Gene nods, recalling what the doctor said about "emotional trauma."<br><br>"Are you scared of bees?" he asks Frankie. "Is that something that's bothering you?"<br><br>"No," Frankie says. "Not really."<br><br>When Frankie was three, a bee stung him above his left eyebrow. They had been out hiking together, and they hadn't yet learned that Frankie was "moderately allergic" to bee stings. Within minutes of the sting, Frankie's face had begun to distort, to puff up, his eye welling shut. He looked deformed. Gene didn't know if he'd ever been more frightened in his entire life, running down the trail with Frankie's head pressed against his heart, trying to get to the car and drive him to the doctor, terrified that the child was dying. Frankie himself was calm.<br><br>Gene clears his throat. He knows the feeling that Frankie is talking about-he has felt it himself, that odd, feathery vibration inside his head. And in fact he feels it again, now. He presses the pads of his fingertips against his brow. Emotional trauma, his mind murmurs, but he is thinking of DJ, not Frankie.<br><br>"What are you scared of?" Gene asks Frankie, after a moment. "Anything?"<br><br>"You know what the scariest thing is?" Frankie says, and widens his eyes, miming a frightened look. "There's a lady with no head, and she went walking through the woods, looking for it. 'Give . . . me . . . back . . . my . . . head . . .' "<br><br>"Where on earth did you hear a story like that!" Karen says.<br><br>"Daddy told me," Frankie says. "When we were camping."<br><br>Gene blushes, even before Karen gives him a sharp look. "Oh, great," she says. "Wonderful."<br><br>He doesn't meet her eyes. "We were just telling ghost stories," he says, softly. "I thought he would think the story was funny."<br><br>"My God, Gene," she says. "With him having nightmares like this? What were you thinking?"<br><br>It's a bad flashback, the kind of thing he's usually able to avoid. He thinks abruptly of Mandy, his former wife. He sees in Karen's face that look Mandy would give him when he screwed up. "What are you, some kind of idiot?" Mandy used to say. "Are you crazy?" Back then, Gene couldn't do anything right, it seemed, and when Mandy yelled at him it made his stomach clench with shame and inarticulate rage. I was trying, he would think, I was trying, damn it, and it was as if no matter what he did, it wouldn't turn out right. That feeling would sit heavily in his chest, and eventually, when things got worse, he hit her once. "Why do you want me to feel like shit," he said through clenched teeth. "I'm not an asshole," he said, and when she rolled her eyes at him he slapped her hard enough to knock her out of her chair.<br><br>That was the time he'd taken DJ to the carnival. It was a Saturday, and he'd been drinking a little, so Mandy didn't like it, but after all-he thought-DJ was his son, too, he had a right to spend some time with his own son, Mandy wasn't his boss even if she might think she was. She liked to make him hate himself.<br><br>What she was mad about was that he'd taken DJ on the Velocerator. It was a mistake, he'd realized afterward. But DJ himself had begged to go on. He was just recently four years old, and Gene had just turned twenty-three, which made him feel inexplicably old. He wanted to have a little fun.<br><br>Besides, nobody told him he couldn't take DJ on the thing. When he led DJ through the gate, the ticket taker even smiled, as if to say, "Here is a young guy showing his kid a good time." Gene winked at DJ and grinned, taking a nip from a flask of peppermint schnapps. He felt like a good dad. He wished his own father had taken him on rides at the carnival!<br><br>The door to the Velocerator opened like a hatch in a big silver flying saucer. Disco music was blaring from the entrance and became louder as they went inside. It was a circular room with soft, padded walls, and one of the workers had Gene and DJ stand with their backs to the wall, strapping them in side by side.

Christopher draws inspiration for the world of Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, from the natural beauty that surrounds his home in Montana: the tumultuous weather, the rushing Yellowstone River, and the soaring Beartooth Mountains. <br><br>Read on for Paolini and Tad Williams's discussion about why they write fantasy, their upcoming projects, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Tad:</strong> Hi, Christopher. Nice to talk to you, albeit virtually. It was great hanging out with you and your family this summer. Pretty much all of us fell in love with your part of the world, too. <br><br> Be warned: this isn't my best time of the day, so if I start calling you "Herman" and asking what it was about whaling that interested you, please forgive. <br><br> The first thing I'd like to ask you as a starter question is: why fantasy? I mean, there's the obvious answer (which is also true for me) that it was something I loved to read growing up, but I guess I'm curious what is it that still resonates for you. Why do these kind of stories, these kinds of characters, these kinds of worlds, still speak to you? <br> In a similar vein, do you have another kind of fiction, another genre, that you'd really like to try? If so, why? Any genres you think you'll never write but wish you could? <br> <br> <strong>Christopher:</strong> Hi Tad. Great talking to you as well. We all had a wonderful time when you guys visited. Definitely one of the highlights of the year. <br> <br> I'm still waking up as well -- takes a few cups of tea and a few strips of bacon before the little gray cells start firing properly -- so if I sound a bit muddled, that's why. Still, we can make a stab at coherency, eh? <br><br> Hmm. Why do I write fantasy? As you said, it's because I enjoy reading it, but I enjoy reading it because . . . well, for a number of reasons, I suppose. First of all, fantasy allows for all sorts of dangerous situations, and those can provide a lot of excitement in a story. And excitement is always fun. Also, epic fantasy usually deals with themes and situations that everyone can relate to, such as the challenge of growing up, or how one is supposed to deal with moral quandaries. Fantasy is the oldest form of literature; the very first stories that humans told while crouched around campfires were stories about gods and monsters and tragic mistakes and heroic feats. Even now, those topics still resonate with us on a primal level, which is one reason I think fantasy will remain popular with readers as long as humans are still human. And I love the sense of awe and wonder one can often find in fantastical literature. . . . Fantasy can allow you to see and hear and experience things that have never existed and never *could* exist. To me, that is the closest we come to real magic in this world. <br><br>&nbsp; That said, there are a number of other genres I'd like to try my hand at: mystery, thriller, horror, science-fiction, romance, etc. I love stories of all kinds -- although mythic ones certainly hold the greatest appeal to me -- and I'm very much looking forward to experimenting once I finish the Inheritance cycle. Any genres I think I'll never write but wish I could? . . . Probably long-form epic poetry or a witty comedy of manners. Poetry is fun, but my grasp on it is rather shaky, and a comedy of manners (while I enjoy them) is so different from my usual life, I'm not sure I could pull it off properly. <br> <br> And now a question for you: You have just finished your third (large) series. What is it about big epic stories that so fascinates you? Why not write small, intimate books about a fishmonger whose greatest love is his toothpick sculpture of the Brooklyn Bridge? <br> <br> <strong> Read the full conversation </strong><b>Tad Williams</b> has held more jobs than any sane person should admit to&#x2014;singing in a band, selling shoes, managing a financial institution, throwing newspapers, and designing military manuals, to name just a few.

The coverage of these innovations, in a new chapter called "Monitoring Earth," is this book's best feature. It provides useful overviews, at a level of detail and in a vocabulary that is perfect for the audience, of concepts such as satellite laser ranging, which is used to measure the movement of continents, and the use of satellites in mapping the ozone layer. The rest of the book discusses the planet's formation; plate tectonics; methods of rock creation; how the sea, ice, and wind change the landscape; deciphering Earth's history from fossils and other rocks; exploitation of rocks and minerals, and, in another updated section, provides lists of prominent geologists and relevant institutions. The presentation in these chapters is overly succinct for such complex information, resulting in difficult reading (with no glossary) and loss of important detail. In one chapter, a 543-million-year-period is shoehorned into 30 pages. The illustrations are particularly disappointing. It is standard practice to show geological processes in simple line diagrams. These are provided, and are useful, as far as they go. But the few photographs mean that students have little opportunity to see the features produced by the forces that are so ably diagrammed.

Her first novel, Strangers on a Train, was made into a classic film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1951. The Talented Mr Ripley, published in 1955, introduced the fascinating anti-hero Tom Ripley, and was made into an Oscar-winning film in 1999 by Anthony Minghella. Graham Greene called Patricia Highsmith &#39;the poet of apprehension&#39;, saying that she &#39;created a world of her own - a world claustrophobic and irrational which we enter each time with a sense of personal danger&#39; and The Times named her no.1 in their list of the greatest ever crime writers.

Do you feel burdened by guilt or shame over past or present failures? Do you struggle with painful life circumstances that you feel powerless to control? Do you wonder where God is and why He doesn&#x2019;t seem to help? Do you feel confused about the promise of abundant life and wonder why you&#x2019;re missing out? You are not alone. I began life with many hopes and dreams, yet over time I felt beaten and battered by life circumstances or my poor choices. Confused and overwhelmed, I forced myself to conform my outside to what was expected of me by trying to achieve greater accomplishments, acquire more things and perfect my image. Yet inside, despite all this effort, I was filled with sadness, emptiness, insecurity and loneliness. So began my quest to find hope and peace in my life. Trusting in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior, studying the Bible, participating in 12 Step recovery programs and learning to listen and respond to the loving wisdom of the Holy Spirit caused significant changes in my life. I have personally experienced God&#x2019;s healing from shame and guilt of my past and freedom from the need for approval from others. Now that I live with a desperate dependence on God alone, I have peace I never had before. The journey was not easy. I encountered, and continue to encounter, many obstacles. But daily God convinces me that He is my only hope. That is why I&#x2019;m inviting you to join me and enter into a similar transformational, discipleship journey with God. On this journey we will not just be students who learn more information, but disciples who, empowered by the Holy Spirit, learn the Truth, the Way and the Life. On the journey we will have our thinking challenged, our understanding expanded, our hearts opened and our wounds healed. We will become participants, not spectators, in God&#x2019;s plan and purpose. My prayer for you is that along the way, God will help you recover the truth of who you really are and who He is. I pray also that you will grow in your trust of Him as you come to know His goodness and unfailing love for you. As we take this journey together, I pray you will mysteriously and miraculously experience the healing power of God in your life. I pray you will enter into a love relationship with Him that is more amazing than you ever imagined or hoped for as He redeems, heals and restores you to your true identity and inheritance as His child living in His Kingdom of Grace.</p><p>Lynn Hoffmann was born and raised in rural Rhode Island and later moved to southern Florida.

It is the masterwork of a writer long recognized as one of America's most gifted prose stylists and now increasingly celebrated as one of our finest writers. <br><b>"Tosches writes like a dark angel." --<i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i></b></p><p>Nick Tosches is the author of two previous novels, Cut Numbers and Trinities. His nonfiction works include Where Dead Voices Gather, The Devil and Sonny Liston, Dino, Power on Earth, Hellfire, Country, and Unsung Heroes of Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll. He lives in New York City.Deftly blending the sacred and the profane, Tosches boldly casts himself as the protagonist in his latest novel, an outrageously ambitious book in which he procures a purloined version of the original manuscript of The Divine Comedy while tracing Dante's journey as Dante struggled to complete his penultimate work. The initial chapters find Tosches looking back and questioning the results of his fascinating life and career, with a brief but devastating aside about the decline of publishing. But Tosches suddenly emerges from his morbid nostalgia when a former character named Louie (a gangster from Tosches's Cut Numbers) gets his hands on a stolen copy of Dante's manuscript and asks Tosches to authenticate it. That sends the author on a whirlwind tour to Arizona, Chicago, Paris and then London as he tries to verify the work and then determine its worth on the open market. The subplot involving Dante's journey is flat and stale by comparison, despite some impeccable scholarship by Tosches as he chronicles the great poet's efforts and setbacks. Tosches's sense of the shock value of his story line doesn't waver, and there's never a dull moment as he opines about modern culture, the Mob, the Oprah Book Club, Zen editing and the joy of being edited, September 11, the artistic process and anything else that happens to hop into his head for a few pages. The ending is a bit of a letdown, but fans of the one-man literary show that is Nick Tosches will doubtless love this book. Overall, it remains incomplete as a novel because of Tosches's inability to bring Dante to life as a character, although the author's admiration for him as a creative force results in a number of compelling passages.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Bone and Sinew of the Land: America&#39;s Forgotten Black Pioneers and the Struggle for Equality</h2><p><b>The long-hidden stories of America's black pioneers, the frontier they settled, and their fight for the heart of the nation</b><br>When black settlers Keziah and Charles Grier started clearing their frontier land in 1818, they couldn't know that they were part of the nation's earliest struggle for equality; they were just looking to build a better life. But within a few years, the Griers would become early Underground Railroad conductors, joining with fellow pioneers and other allies to confront the growing tyranny of bondage and injustice.<br><i>The Bone and Sinew of the Land</i> tells the Griers' story and the stories of many others like them: the lost history of the nation's first Great Migration. In building hundreds of settlements on the frontier, these black pioneers were making a stand for equality and freedom. Their new home, the Northwest Territory--the wild region that would become present-day Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin--was the first territory to ban slavery and have equal voting rights for all men. Though forgotten today, in their own time the successes of these pioneers made them the targets of racist backlash. Political and even armed battles soon ensued, tearing apart families and communities long before the Civil War. This groundbreaking work of research reveals America's forgotten frontier, where these settlers were inspired by the belief that all men are created equal and a brighter future was possible. <br><b>Named one of Smithsonian's Best History Books of 2018</b></p><p><b>Anna-Lisa Cox </b>is the author of <i>A Stronger Kinship: One Town's Extraordinary Story of Hope and Faith</i>, and an award-winning historian.

She lives in Michigan."Tracing the free black families who settled the nation's first frontier, the great Northwest Territory, Anna-Lisa Cox convincingly shows that African American history has always been interwoven with the pioneer experience in America. At the same time, she reveals the blurred, often dangerous lines between freedom and bondage even in the territories that the Founding Fathers established from the beginning to be beyond the reach of America's original sin: slavery. In introducing us to the Grier and Lyle families, among others for whom land was the dream, Cox uncovers a rich history that may surprise even those most devoted to the study of African American history. <i>The Bone and Sinew of the Land</i> is a revelation of primary historical research that is written with the beauty and empathic powers of a novel."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</b>, Harvard University</i></b><br><br>"The journey of America's Black pioneers is a story that remains unknown to Americans like the frontiers they settled. Starting in the earliest days of the republic, these brave men and women built new lives far away from the White enslavers who doubted them, threatened them, and attacked them.

Cox convincingly reframes the symbolic importance of American pioneers by proving how free black families and communities were shaping their own destinies in America's first frontier of the nineteenth century. Free black people were creating and framing their own destinies across a wide geography through a deep connection to land ownership and politics. This work will not only influence scholarship.

Forgotten are those people who were possessed and their family members. In this book, the very people who suffered the indescribable tell the true story of their trials in which tragedy turns to victory, thanks to the help of a humble and generous Franciscan exorcist.Beginning with an exegesis of Christ&#39;s exorcism narratives in the Gospel of Mark, we then come to the main body of the book: 14 people give their testimony of diabolical possession.

Fortunately, her imagination comes to the rescue, helping her to invent a fascinating family history.</p><p>Ellen Conford is the well-loved author of more than thirty books, including several about the irrepressible Jenny Archer. She lives in Great Neck, New York.<br>Grade 2-4-- The latest addition to the series is competent and entertaining. Jenny's first composition, wherein she describes some of her games of make-believe, serves as a point of departure for her next venture in writing. The assignment is to write an autobiography, and Jenny is concerned with holding her teacher's interest. Her solution: be creative. She invents humorous, in fact, wildly unbelievable situations anticipating with glee the praise she expects to earn. However, she comes down hard when Mrs. Pike is not at all appreciative. With a little explanatory help from her mother, Jenny writes her own--although boring--life story and wins her way back to her teacher's good graces. Jenny is a kid to like, enthusiastic and eager to learn. Her concerns about school work are true to the age group. Conford does just what Mrs. Pike praises Jenny for doing: she says "a lot in just a few words." Students will want their own teachers to read this to them and then to read it again on their own. --Ruth Semrau, Lovejoy School, McKinney, TX<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Well</h2><p><p>The acclaimed writer and performer Lisa Kron&#x2019;s newest work is all about her mom.

The&nbsp;dormant gardens glimmered with frost. The skies seemed low enough&nbsp;to touch.&nbsp;<br><br>Aunt Tally, two weeks away from her one- hundredth birthday, called&nbsp;her Gordon setter, Doodles.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;As the young dog joyfully returned to his master, Aunt Tally leaned&nbsp;on her silver- headed cane, the head being in the graceful shape of a&nbsp;hound. Apart from having to use that cane&#x2014;thanks to the usual involuntary&nbsp;dismounts all horsewomen take&#x2014;she betrayed few signs of&nbsp;her advanced years. Had you seen her peering at the ground as she&nbsp;walked along, you would have pegged her at eighty, perhaps.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;More snow coming.&#x201d; She squinted at the sky this March 11,&nbsp;Wednesday.&nbsp;<br><br>Doodles, who had sharper senses, replied, <i>&#x201c;Before sundown.&#x201d;&nbsp;</i>Aunt Tally stroked the dog&#x2019;s head upon hearing the little yodel.&nbsp;Tightening her cashmere scarf, she continued on.&nbsp;<br><br>A deep rumble alerted Doodles, who recognized the motor&#x2019;s signature&nbsp;sound as well as the sound of the tires. Identifying a vehicle by its&nbsp;tire sound and motor is easy for dogs. Humans can&#x2019;t do it.&nbsp;Doodles wagged her tail as she bounded up to the front of the&nbsp;house, where Marilyn &#x201c;Big Mim&#x201d; Sanburne, Tally&#x2019;s niece, had parked&nbsp;her brand-new Dodge half- ton.&nbsp;<br><br>The two walked to the back of the house to join Tally.&nbsp;<br><br>Big Mim, teasingly called &#x201c;The Queen of Crozet,&#x201d; was a formidable&nbsp;woman. However, even Big Mim could be backed off by the small,&nbsp;lean Tally.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing out here? It&#x2019;s 24�F.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Checking for my crocus. A shoot here and a shoot there and I get&nbsp;to thinking about the redbuds.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Big Mim put one gloved hand on her hip. &#x201c;Redbuds aren&#x2019;t going to&nbsp;be in full flower until about April fifteenth. You know that.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I do. That doesn&#x2019;t mean I can&#x2019;t check them.&#x201d; She tapped&nbsp;her cane on the old brick. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m longing for spring. By this time of the&nbsp;year I&#x2019;ve had enough.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You really will have enough if you don&#x2019;t come in out of the cold.&nbsp;You&#x2019;ll catch your death.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a baseball,&#x201d; the old woman replied.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;You know what I mean,&#x201d; Big Mim said, sounding tolerant. &#x201c;Are&nbsp;you ready to go, or do you need anything from the house?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Just need to put up the dog.&#x201d; Aunt Tally walked to the back door,&nbsp;opened it, and Doodles scooted in, happy for the warmth.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Purse?&#x201d; Big Mim raised an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;My wallet&#x2019;s in my coat pocket. Purses are a pain. Even if I find one&nbsp;that slings just right over my shoulder, sooner or later it drops down.&nbsp;Hard to carry a purse with a cane.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Guess it is.&#x201d; Big Mim walked to the passenger side of her blue&nbsp;truck and opened the door for Tally, who climbed in unassisted.&nbsp;Once out on the road, the two chattered as only two people who&nbsp;have known each other all their lives can. Aunt Tally had been pushing&nbsp;thirty when Big Mim was born. It was a day of celebration. Aunt&nbsp;Tally, thanks to a disastrous love affair when young, shied away from&nbsp;marriage but not affairs. She treated Big Mim as her own daughter,&nbsp;which had occasioned some arguments with Tally&#x2019;s late, loved sister.&nbsp;A brother to Big Mim followed later, but he died on the hideous&nbsp;Bataan Death March. Apart from rage and grief, the result was that&nbsp;no Urquhart of any succeeding generation would buy a Japanese car&nbsp;or any product if they could help it. As with all old Virginia families,&nbsp;regard less of generations of marriages on both the male and female&nbsp;sides, they generally referred to themselves by the surname of the first&nbsp;European to settle on Virginia soil. In this case, the Urquharts.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Speech?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Aunt Tally, staring straight ahead, raised her voice a bit. &#x201c;Oh, Mimsy,&nbsp;I make notes. I read them. I throw them out. I can&#x2019;t bear the thought&nbsp;of standing up there spouting bromides and sentimental mush. I&nbsp;haven&#x2019;t found what I want to say.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a first.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Aunt Tally ignored this, instead concentrating on an upcoming&nbsp;T-cross. Her farm, Rose Hill, reposed about four miles west of Harry&nbsp;Haristeen&#x2019;s farm. They&#x2019;d passed Harry&#x2019;s place on the way to Crozet,&nbsp;reaching the intersection of a dirt road and the two- lane paved highway&nbsp;on which they traveled.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Can never drive over this without thinking about Ralston Peavey.&#x201d;&nbsp;Aunt Tally repositioned her cane to her left side. &#x201c;Never found his&nbsp;murderer.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Someone really wanted him out of this world.&#x201d; Big Mim remembered&nbsp;it, as well. &#x201c;Fall, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Aunt Tally nodded in affirmation. &#x201c;A light frost, patchy fog.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;1964. The year sticks in my head because that was the first year&nbsp;Jim was elected mayor.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Jim Sanburne, her husband, remained mayor, and their daughter,&nbsp;Little Mim, was now vice mayor. The joke was, father and daughter&nbsp;came from two different political parties. Being a small town,&nbsp;Crozet never bothered with term limits. Jim, a good mayor, would&nbsp;most likely retain his office until such day as he died.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Jim picked up the call from Dinny Myers; wish we had him back.&nbsp;There was a sheriff with sense,&#x201d; Aunt Tally mumbled.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, the one we have now has sense. You just think everything was&nbsp;better when you were younger.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Twas.&#x201d; Aunt Tally raised her voice. &#x201c;This country is going to hell&nbsp;in a handbasket. Well, I&#x2019;m not going off on that; it&#x2019;ll ruin my day. But&nbsp;even you have to admit that Ralston Peavey was the best blacksmith&nbsp;you ever saw.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;He was. He was.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Pleased with her little victory, Aunt Tally recalled the details as they&nbsp;rolled over the spot. &#x201c;Found Ralston right here, spread- eagled in the&nbsp;middle of the road, facedown. Run over one way and then backed&nbsp;over. To make sure he was dead, I reckon.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Jim saw him before Dinny removed the corpse. Said the tire tracks&nbsp;were clear. They hoped to find the killer from the tire treads. Never&nbsp;happened, of course.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Dinny and the department really did check every set of tires in the&nbsp;area. He couldn&#x2019;t do all of Albemarle County, but he did check Crozet.&nbsp;Nothing. Not one thing. Some folks thought whoever did it was not&nbsp;from these parts. Not me. I think it was one of us.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Big Mim slowed for a curve. &#x201c;Well, Ralston could drink. He was&nbsp;pretty loaded.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t lie down in the middle of the road because he was&nbsp;drunk.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;His truck was by the side of the road.&#x201d; Big Mim, who enjoyed&nbsp;driving her new truck, picked up speed. &#x201c;I still think he&#x2019;d been fooling&nbsp;around, and the husband found out and killed him.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe, but we all knew who was weak that way. He&#x2019;d never done&nbsp;it before. Two kids&#x2014;what, eight and ten&#x2014;and he seemed to get along&nbsp;with them. I wonder if it wasn&#x2019;t something else. Couldn&#x2019;t be drugs.&nbsp;That hadn&#x2019;t taken off yet.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t imagine Ralston a dealer. Although, being a blacksmith, he&nbsp;had the perfect job for distributing.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Aunt Tally shook her head. &#x201c;Something else.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Big Mim paused. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say not a stone was left unturned.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;One was, or we&#x2019;d have the killer.&#x201d; Tally frowned.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;After all this time, maybe he&#x2019;s dead himself.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Mimsy, I&#x2019;ve seen a lot. One of these days, might be 2050, the truth&nbsp;will wriggle out. Always does.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Talk to Inez?&#x201d; Big Mim mentioned Aunt Tally&#x2019;s best friend, who&nbsp;had graduated from William Woods University&#x2014;then known as&nbsp;William Woods College&#x2014;two years behind Aunt Tally. The lovely&nbsp;school, located in Fulton, Missouri, had provided Aunt Tally with her&nbsp;first taste of life outside Virginia.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s flying in two days before, because of the alumnae board&nbsp;meeting.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Good. Harry&#x2019;s driving.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Mary Minor &#x201c;Harry&#x201d; Haristeen was not a William Woods graduate.&nbsp;She had graduated from Smith College. Age forty, best described as an&nbsp;attractive tomboy, she now put all her attentions to farming, her true&nbsp;love, as she&#x2019;d quit her job at the post office two years earlier. Harry&nbsp;would be going to the celebration at Aunt Tally&#x2019;s alma mater because&nbsp;she loved the old lady and knew the event was not to be missed,&nbsp;especi ally since the salty woman would give a speech. &#x201c;Be good for&nbsp;Harry to get away,&#x201d; Aunt Tally said.&nbsp;<br><br>At that moment, Harry had her hands full with a William Woods&nbsp;alumna, no less.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Event Design Handbook: Systematically Design Innovative Events Using the #EventCanvas</h2><p>This handbook will change the way you think about how events change the world you live in.

She could imitate his voice to perfection, and Proust himself said to her, "You know everything about me." Her reminiscences of her employer present an intimate picture of the daily life of a great writer who was also a deeply peculiar man, while Madame Albaret herself proves to be a shrewd and engaging companion.</p><p>C�leste Albaret (1892-1984) was born into a peasant family in the mountainous region of Loz�re, France. In 1913, she married Odilon Albaret, a Parisian chauffeur, whose clients included Marcel Proust. Odilon suggested that his new wife, who was lonely in the big city and at a loss for something to do, run errands for Proust, and before long C�leste found herself employed as the writer&#x2019;s full-time (indeed round-the-clock) housekeeper, secretary, and nurse, filling those roles until his death in 1922. In later years, C�leste ran a small hotel in Paris with her husband and daughter, and after Odilon&#x2019;s death in 1960, she became the caretaker of the Mus�e Ravel in the town of Montfort l&#x2019;Amaury. <i>Monsieur Proust</i> was published in 1972.

Exiled to the Holy Land at the tender age of 17 by devious politicos after he and his gal pal, Cecilia Algotsdotter, were caught in the act of &#x201c;carnal love,&#x201d; Arn has battled the Saracens, who both fear and respect him, for 10 years as a member of the Templars.

Both lovers never doubt that they will one day be together again as well as be reunited with their son, Magnus, who was taken from Cecilia at birth. The political intrigue, military action, and exotic setting will appeal to both historical fiction readers and adventure buffs.

Follow her @dvegabooks.Gr 9 Up&#x2014;Hendricks arrives in the small New York town of Drearford with her baby brother, her house-flipping parents, and major baggage from her hometown of Philly. Escalating incidents with her former boyfriend Grayson forced her family to relocate with the goal of renovating a run-down old house, which Hendricks soon learns has a macabre history. Several teens, curious about the new girl, quickly fold her into their close-knit group, and even more quickly, school hottie Connor makes it clear he is interested. But with flashbacks and references to troubles with her ex, Hendricks isn't jumping into anything soon. As she learns more about the history of the house, as well as the connections between it and her enigmatic neighbor Eddie, disturbances in the house turn from scary to violent. Ultimately Hendricks and Eddie must battle the house and the hungry spirits that inhabit it. Interplay and dialogue between the teens ring true, more so than the almost nonexistent relationship between Hendricks and her apparently oblivious parents. Allusions to cruel bullying as the catalyst to events almost get lost as the story culminates in a finale that, while dramatic, feels rushed and overcrowded with explanations. The relationship with Grayson and the role alcohol played are intriguing yet used as a red herring rather than fully explored. Socioeconomic status, poverty, and mental illness are examined through the equally haunted Eddie, who feels that there is something "rotten" with the entire town.

But under this fa�ade lies a country still haunted by its years of terror. <br><br> Although the international community tried to rebuild Cambodia and introduce democracy in the 1990s, in the country remained in the grip of a venal government. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Joel Brinkley learned that almost a half of Cambodianswho lived through the Khmer Rouge era suffered from P.T.S.D.--and had passed their trauma to the next generation. His extensive close-up reporting in <i>Cambodia's Curse</i> illuminates the country, its people, and the deep historical roots of its modern-day behavior.</p><p><b>Joel Brinkley</b>, a professor of journalism at Stanford University, is a twenty-three-year veteran of the <i>New York Times</i>.

This is his fifth book.Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist Brinkley takes on the pricey pitfalls of nation building and the labyrinth of centuries-old political corruption in this riveting piece of literary reportage. At once a tale of human tragedy and a primer on the future of Western engagement with developing&#x2014;and autocratic&#x2014;countries, the book offers a rare look inside a country beleaguered by poverty and imprisoned by patronage and venal leadership since the 13th century; traumatized by colonialism, Pol Pot's brutal Khmer Rouge, and the genocide he unleashed (and later by Vietnam, which overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979). Brinkley is merciless in his critique of both Cambodia's leadership as well as the folly of donor countries that placed faith in the U.N. to bring Cambodia into a modern, democratic era. He expresses empathy for "the most abused people in the world," many of whom are in the grip of post-traumatic stress disorders after Pol Pot's reign of terror, but he saves his mercenary eye for the corrupt leaders, including present dictator Hun Sen, who continue to suppress and exploit the country's resources and young, vital population.

A brilliant 18th-century Irish philosopher and statesman, Burke was a fierce champion of human rights and the Anglo-American constitutional tradition, and a lifelong campaigner against arbitrary power. Once revered by an array of great Americans including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, Burke has been almost forgotten in recent years. But as politician and political philosopher Jesse Norman argues in this penetrating biography, we cannot understand modern politics without him.<br>As Norman reveals, Burke was often ahead of his time, anticipating the abolition of slavery and arguing for free markets, equality for Catholics in Ireland, responsible government in India, and more. He was not always popular in his own lifetime, but his ideas about power, community, and civic virtue have endured long past his death. Indeed, Burke engaged with many of the same issues politicians face today, including the rise of ideological extremism, the loss of social cohesion, the dangers of the corporate state, and the effects of revolution on societies. He offers us now a compelling critique of liberal individualism, and a vision of society based not on a self-interested agreement among individuals, but rather on an enduring covenant between generations. <br>Burke won admirers in the American colonies for recognizing their fierce spirit of liberty and for speaking out against British oppression, but his greatest triumph was seeing through the utopian aura of the French Revolution. In repudiating that revolution, Burke laid the basis for much of the robust conservative ideology that remains with us to this day: one that is adaptable and forward-thinking, but also mindful of the debt we owe to past generations and our duty to preserve and uphold the institutions we have inherited. He is the first conservative.<br>A rich, accessible, and provocative biography, Edmund Burke describes Burke's life and achievements alongside his momentous legacy, showing how Burke's analytical mind and deep capacity for empathy made him such a vital thinker-both for his own age, and for ours.thread on pub day of what people at basic like about it (editors)<br><b>"You won't find a more impressive political philosopher than the 18th-century MP who more or less invented Anglosphere conservatism.

This succinct volume presents his findings, approaching the topic from four directions. The first chapter examines the doctrine of rebirth as it is presented in the earliest Buddhist sources and the way it relates to core doctrinal principles. The second chapter reviews debates about rebirth throughout Buddhist history and up to modern times, noting the role of confirmation bias in evaluation of evidence. Chapter 3 reviews the merits of current research on rebirth, including near-death experience, past-life regression, and children who recall previous lives. The chapter concludes with an examination of xenoglossy, the ability to speak languages one has not learned previously, and chapter 4 examines the particular case of Dhammaruwan, a Sri Lankan boy who chants Pali texts that he does not appear to have learned in his present life. <i>Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research</i> brings together the many strands of the debate on rebirth in one place, making it both comprehensive and compact. It is not a polemic but an interrogation of the evidence, and it leaves readers to come to their own conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Bhikkhu Analayo</b><b>&nbsp;</b>was&nbsp;born in 1962 in Germany and&nbsp;ordained in 1995 in Sri Lanka, where&nbsp;he completed a PhD on the&nbsp;<i>Satipatthana-sutta</i>&nbsp;in 2000. He next completed a habilitation research in Germany in 2007, in which he compared the&nbsp;<i>Majjhima-nikaya</i>&nbsp;discourses with their Chinese, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, and Tibetan counterparts. At present Bhikkhu Analayo is a professor of Buddhist Studies; his main research area is early Buddhism, with a particular focus on the topics of the Chinese&nbsp;<i>Agama</i>s, Buddhist meditation, and women in Buddhism. Besides his academic pursuits, he regularly teaches meditation. He presently resides at the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies in Massachusetts, where he spends most of his time in silent meditation retreat."Bhikkhu Analayo moves effortlessly from an illuminating presentation of classical Buddhist conceptions of birth and death to a meticulous investigation of intriguing, though inconclusive, paranormal reports. In so doing this erudite and intellectually generous monastic scholar offers sound historical and philological instruction, while at the same time bringing home essential Buddhist wisdom about our calling to face death mindfully and with serene hope. A fascinating study." Author: Carol Zaleski<br><br>&#x201c;From his unique perspective as an academic scholar and a monastic, Bhikkhu Analayo provides a thorough explanation of the early Buddhist doctrine of rebirth and the debates about it in ancient India and early imperial China, as well as a judicious analysis of various phenomena that some people have taken to be evidence for rebirth. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in these fascinating topics.&#x201d; Author: Evan Thompson, author of Waking, Dreaming, Being: Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy<br><br>&#x201c;Bhikkhu Analayo offers a detailed study of the much-debated Buddhist doctrine of rebirth and a survey of relevant evidence. He also investigates the Pali chantings of Dhammaruwan, who at a very young age would spontaneously chant ancient and complex Buddhist suttas. I first met Dhammaruwan when he was seven years old, when my teacher, Anagarika Munindraji, and I visited him and his family in Sri Lanka. <i>Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research</i> illuminates a complex topic with great clarity and understanding.&#x201d; Author: Joseph Goldstein, author of Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening<br><br>&#x201c;Bhikkhu Analayo&#x2019;s book <i>Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research</i> is a refreshing breath of fresh air. While drawing on the most authoritative sources in the Buddhist canons to explain the Buddha&#x2019;s unique insights into rebirth and karma, the author also cites current research into the continuity of consciousness from one life to the next. This book points to the principle of conservation of consciousness, analogous to the conservation of mass-energy, as one of the fundamental truths of the natural world.&#x201d; Author: B.

But the murder has stirred up memories long since buried, precipitating a series of events no one could have foreseen. As the truth unfolds, we come to learn the secrets held by this parched landscape, hidden deep within the shared past of a family and their conflicted nation.&nbsp;Spanning Kenya&#x2019;s turbulent 1950s and 1960s, <i>Dust</i> is spellbinding debut from a breathtaking new voice in literature.</p></p><p><p>Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor was born in Kenya.

At Wilson Airport, a qhat-carrying eight-seater plane weaves its way off the apron. The last small plane out of Nairobi without top-level permission for the next week. Above the airport din, egrets circle and ibises cry ngangan- ganga. Father, daughter, and son are going home.<br> Dusk is Odidi&#x2019;s time. In the contours of old pasts, Ajany retrieves an image: She is sitting on a black-gray rock, spying on the sun&#x2019;s descent with Odidi. Leaning into his shoulder, trying to read the world as he does, she stammers, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d; He says, &#x201c;Descending into hell,&#x201d; and cackles. She had only just learned the Apostles&#x2019; Creed.<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> The plane lifts off. <br> The coffin and its keepers are nestled amid bales of green herbs.<br> Straight-backed, stern, silences reordered, Nyipir is a chiseled stone icon again, an archetypal Nilotic male. But there are deep furrows on his forehead. She can paint these, too. Trail markers into absence. Ajany had once believed Baba was omnipotent, like God, ever since he had invoked a black leopard to hunt down the mean and red-eyed inhabit- ants of her nightmares.<br> She trembles. <br> Nyipir asks, &#x201c;Cold?&#x201d;<br> Baba&#x2019;s baritone, Odidi&#x2019;s echo. Dimpled handsomeness. The Oganda men were gifted with soft-edged, rumbling voices. <br> Ajany turns. The light of the sky bounces on her thin face, all<br> bones and angles. Fresh bloodstains on her sleeves. The frills of her orange skirt are soiled. She is tinier than Nyipir remembers. But she had always been such a small, stuttering thing, all big hair and large eyes. More shadow than person, head slanted as if waiting for answers to ancient riddles. He clears his throat. From the gloom of his soul, Nyipir growls, &#x201c;Mama . . . er . . . she wanted to . . . uh . . . come to meet you.&#x201d;<br> Ajany hears the lie. Sucks it in, as if it were venom, sketches invis- ible circles on the window. Stares at the green of coffee and pineapple plantations below.<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Nyipir says to himself, already lost, already afraid. He shifts. The dying had started long ago. Long before the murder of prophets named Pio, Tom, Argwings, Ronald, Kungu, Josiah, Ouko, Mbae. The others, the &#x201c;disappeared unknown.&#x201d; National doors slammed over vaults of secrets. Soon the wise chose cowardice, a way of life: not hearing, not seeing, never asking, because sound, like dreams, could cause death. Sound gave up names, especially those of friends. It co-opted silence as an eavesdropper; casual conversations heard were delivered to the state to murder. In time neighborhood kai-apple fences were urged into thicker and higher growth to shut out the dread-filled nation. But some of the lost, the unseen and unheard, cut tracks into Nyipir&#x2019;s sleep. They stared at him in silence until the day his disordered dreams stepped into daylight with him to become his life:<br> They had pointed a gun to his head. <br> Click, click, click.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had fallen to the ground, slithered on his belly like a snake, hissed, and vomited, because he had forgotten how to talk.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today. <br> Sweat on palms, heartbeat quickening, Nyipir swallows. A groan.<br> Ajany hears a father&#x2019;s leaching anguish. She scratches an ache where it itches her skin, gropes inside-places as a tongue probing cavities does. Expecting to be stung.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today. <br> The past&#x2019;s beckon is persistent. <br> From the air, Nyipir peers down at an expanding abyss. His country, his home, is ripping itself apart. Stillborn ballot revolution. These 2007 elections were supposed to be simple, the next small jump into a light-filled Kenyan future. Everything had instead disintegrated into a single, unending howl by the nation&#x2019;s unrequited dead. This country, this haunted ideal, all its poor, broken promises. Nyipir watches, arm- pits damp. A view of ground-lit smoke. Dry lips. His people had never set their nation on fire before.<br> On the ground, that night, in a furtive ceremony, beneath a half- moon, a chubby man will mutter an oath that will render him the presi- dent of a burning, dying country. The deed will add fuel to an already out-of-control national grieving.<br> Nyipir turns from the window. <br> He is flying home with his children. <br> Yet he is alone. Memories are solitary ghosts. <br> He lets them in, traveling with them.</p><h2>Boys in Control (Boy/Girl Battle)</h2><p>Play ball! That&#x2019;s what the sixth-grade Buckman Badgers baseball team plans on doing. Eddie Malloy and Jake Hatford hope to lead their team to the championship game the last Saturday in May. But due to a mix-up, Mrs. Hatford has to run a yard sale for the Women&#x2019;s Auxiliary of the Buckman Fire Department the very same day in their very own yard! Not wanting to miss out on the game, the family elects the only nonbaseball fan in the family, Wally, to stay home and help watch over the sale tables until they return. Wally&#x2019;s ticked off. On top of that, Caroline Malloy has written and will perform a play for a school project and has roped Wally into costarring with her. Let Caroline think she&#x2019;s so smart. Wally has his own reason for being in the play. It looks like the Hatfords could be totally humiliated after the girls stumble upon an embarrassing item from the boys&#x2019; past. Leave it to Wally&#x2019;s secret plan to turn the tables on the girls&#x2019; scheme and prove who&#x2019;s really in control! Boys rule!</p><p>Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has written over 100 books, many of which take place in West Virginia.One<br><br>Stuck<br><br>Wally Hatford took two baseball cards from his dresser--Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez--and stuck them in a jacket pocket. Jake had given them to him a month before just because he had duplicates, but Wally was going to trade them at school for a magic trick--a box that took a quarter and turned it into a fifty-cent piece.<br><br>When he got downstairs and hung his jacket over a chair, he found his mother moving about the kitchen and talking to herself in a state of great agitation.<br><br>"I must have been clear out of my mind!" she said, lifting the teakettle off the stove and plunking it right back down again. "I don't know what in the world possessed me to say yes last year, when I had no idea what I'd be doing a year from then."<br><br>When Mrs. Hatford talked like this, Wally and his older brothers knew to lie low. Even their father knew that as long as breakfast was on the table, it was better to sit down and butter a biscuit than to ask what she was talking about.<br><br>But Peter, who was in second grade, hadn't learned that yet. He licked the grape jelly off his fingers and asked, "What did you say yes to?"<br><br>Everyone else at the table gave him a silent shake of the head. When Mrs. Hatford started talking, it was sometimes hard to get her to stop, and the boys would be lucky to make it to school on time. But it was too late.<br><br>"The Women's Auxiliary of the Buckman Fire Department's Treats and Treasures yard sale," she said, and immediately sank down in her chair at the end of the table and rested her chin in her hands.<br><br>"Now, that's a mouthful," Mr. Hatford said, hiding a smile behind his mug as he finished the last of his coffee. "Did you promise to clean out our attic and look for things to give to the sale?"<br><br>"I promised to run the sale!" Mrs. Hatford moaned.<br><br>"At the firehouse?"<br><br>"Right here in our yard! Right out there on the driveway! Right up on our front porch!" Mrs. Hatford cried.<br><br>Now all the Hatfords were staring.<br><br>"Well, Ellen, that shouldn't be so hard," said her husband. "I'm sure the boys will help, and I'll do what I can."<br><br>"No, you won't, because the sale happens to be the last Saturday in May, and you know what that is!"<br><br>Wally tried to think, and then he remembered. That would be the day of the final game in the district elementary school baseball championships. And Jake, his brother, was on the Buckman Badgers.<br><br>"If the Badgers make it that far, you know we'll all want to be there rooting for Jake!" Mrs. Hatford said in distress. "I'm certainly going to be taking half days off from work each Saturday in May that he's playing."<br><br>Now it was a family emergency! Wally saw Jake's eyes open wide. Even Josh, Jake's twin, looked startled that his mother might have to be anywhere else on that fateful day. Jake had wanted to play for the Buckman Badgers ever since he was six years old. This was the year, and May was the month, and the twenty-ninth was the day of the championship game.<br><br>But it just so happened, Mrs. Hatford continued, that in the window of every store in town there was a poster about the Treats or Treasures yard sale, which would be held from noon till four on May twenty-ninth at the home of Tom and Ellen Hatford on College Avenue, rain or shine. So there was no getting out of it. On that particular day, she would need to take a whole day off from her job at the hardware store, but how could she be in two places at once?<br><br>There was silence around the kitchen table as sausage gravy congealed on plates and biscuits grew cold.<br><br>"Well, after all the practice I've put in pitching balls to Jake for the last five years, I've got to be at that game," said Mr. Hatford. "If I have to take four vacation days off for baseball, that's okay with me. We hadn't planned on going anywhere this summer."<br><br>"He's my twin brother! I'm going to be there!" said Josh.<br><br>"I've been watching Jake practice ever since I was born!" Peter declared. "I'm going to go sit in the very first row and I'll yell the loudest of all."<br><br>"Well, I'm Jake's mother!" Mrs. Hatford said. "How could I not be at the championship game when my very own son is one of the pitchers? At least, we hope the Badgers will be playing that game."<br><br>Jake scraped up some sausage gravy with his fork and put it in his mouth, looking very smug and important.<br><br>Wally knew what was coming. He knew it before the first word was spoken. He had felt that something was up the moment he'd stepped into the kitchen that morning, in fact. He wondered if he'd sensed it even before he got out of bed. And now the whole family had turned their heads and were looking down the table at him.<br><br>"No," said Wally.<br><br>"Now, Wally," said his father. "There are times when every member of a family has to stand up and be counted."<br><br>"You can count me, but I don't want to do it," said Wally.<br><br>"There are times you have to make sacrifices for the good of the family," said his mother. "And you have to admit that baseball isn't your favorite thing."<br><br>Wally didn't see that this made any difference. Maybe he did think baseball was sort of boring, and maybe he did like to lie back in the bleachers and study the clouds instead of watching the team practice. But did that mean he wanted to stand out on the driveway surrounded by old lamps and curtain rods and picnic hampers, arguing about prices and missing the game? The game that was going to decide the sixth-grade champion of the district?</p><h2>Ignatian Humanism: A Dynamic Spirituality for the Twenty-First Century</h2><p>&#x201c;Ignatian Humanism puts into perspective our contemporary search for a spirituality that responds both to our search for meaning and desire for God.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;John W.

At its heart, Ignatian spirituality is a humanism that defends human rights, prizes learning from other cultures, seeks common ground between science and religion, struggles for justice, and honors a God who is actively at work in creation.<br> &nbsp;The towering achievements of the Jesuits are made tangible by Modras&#x2019;s vivid portraits of Ignatius and five of his successors: Matteo Ricci, the first Westerner at the court of the Chinese emperor; Friederich Spee, who defended women accused of witchcraft; Karl Rahner, the greatest Catholic theologian of the twentieth century; Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the scientist-mystic; and Pedro Arrupe, the charismatic leader of the Jesuits in the years following Vatican II.</p><p><p>Ronald Modras is professor of theology at Saint Louis University.

This title all but cries out for one. Virtually every word of it raises questions. First, Ignatian. Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits, a humanist? If humanism implies anything, it implies a high regard for human freedom. Wasn&#x2019;t it Ignatius Loyola who wrote something to the effect that what he sees as white he will believe to be black if the Catholic Church hierarchy says so? That hardly sounds humanistic. Putting together the words Ignatian and humanism is curious, to say the least. What do I mean by humanism?<br> Or by spirituality, for that matter? Doesn&#x2019;t spirituality have to do with escaping from life&#x2019;s temptations and challenges by going off someplace where people pray all day? What does that have to do with life in the twenty-first century? Don&#x2019;t Ignatius Loyola and the Jesuits go back to the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation, when they battled Protestants as part of the Catholic Counter-Reformation? Most Catholics and Protestants have risen above those old quarrels. What does the sixteenth century have to say to the twenty-first? Answers to some of these questions simply raise more questions.<br> Most of this book is devoted to five Jesuit humanists. In that case, why not just call it Jesuit Humanism? Or, if it&#x2019;s about spirituality, why not Jesuit Spirituality? Why Ignatian? Again, for that matter, why Humanism? Most of these questions will be addressed in the chapters that follow. Some will take the entire book to answer adequately. Others, like the last, can be dealt with at the outset.<br> A book with Ignatian Humanism in the title will not, I hope, mislead librarians into cataloging it next to Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, or Jean-Paul Sartre. This book assumes, on the contrary, that humanism is more encompassing than its narrower, purely secular subspecies. And it makes dual claims. One is that Ignatian spirituality is rooted not in the Catholic Counter-Reformation conflict with Protestantism but in sixteenth-century Renaissance humanism, indeed that its humanistic features are so numerous and intrinsic as to justify calling it a form of humanism. The second claim is that those humanist features make it exceptionally relevant for anyone&#x2014;not just Roman Catholics and maybe not just Christians either&#x2014;looking for a way to live a responsible spiritual life at the dawn of a new century, in which the only constant seems to be change. For a clearer understanding of the two foregoing claims, the reader deserves some immediate explanation of what I mean by three words under discussion here: spirituality, humanism, and Ignatian. The first two have evolved from ideas that reach back deep into the history of Western culture. They have come to acquire disparate, sometimes competing definitions, necessitating the addition of modifying adjectives that point to their particular historical provenance. The third word is one of those adjectives.&nbsp;Spirituality<br> Spirituality is a word moderns tend to identify with matters otherworldly and exotic. It conjures up images of hermits in deserts and gurus on mountaintops. When modified by Catholic adjectives like Benedictine, Carmelite, or Trappist, it brings to mind clicking rosary beads and silent cloisters. In the early 1960s, Protestant theologian Paul Tillich lamented that the words spirit and spiritual had lost any meaning for modern Western culture. Books surveying the religious landscape spoke of secular cities and the death of God. Spirituality was associated with matters pious and churchy. Anyone could see that the churches were in trouble and that the 1960s were anything but pious.<br> If he were alive today, Tillich would express pleasant surprise at the comeback spirituality has made in the last thirty years in North America&#x2014; but then quickly add, he knew we couldn&#x2019;t do without it. Bookstore shelves are crammed with titles ranging from the classics of Western spirituality to Eastern mysticism, Blessed Mother Teresa, and New Age. Without much reflection on the difference, people&#x2014;the younger generation in particular&#x2014; identify themselves as being spiritual but not religious. Though church life is in decline, interest in spirituality is thriving&#x2014;which is not to say that the moguls of popular culture acknowledge it as something central to the human enterprise. The mass media still tend to see spirituality as a fringe phenomenon best ignored except at Christmas and Easter or at times like the 9/11 terrorist attacks when &#x201c;God bless America&#x201d; came so easily to the lips.<br> The resurgent interest in spirituality merits reflection, if only because it tells us something important about ourselves. At the same time that science and technology are creating new forms of life and already have the basic knowledge and skills to clone human life, we are experiencing a need to talk about ourselves in terms other than DNA molecules and genes. When biologists demonstrate how little genetic difference there is between human beings and higher primates, when anthropologists discover the bones of ancestors that we share with those primates on our evolutionary family tree, we are drawn to focus on that difference. There is something at our core that resists being reduced to merely bigger brains and clever thumbs.<br> The word spirit is how we talk about that core. The English&#x2014;along with the Italian and Spanish&#x2014;goes back to the Latin spiritus, which, like its Hebrew and Greek counterparts, has to do with wind, the air we breathe, and, as a result, life. Spirit is what the prescientific ancients saw as the difference between a living person and a corpse. In German, Geist links spirit to the Geisteswissenschaften, the &#x201c;sciences of the spirit&#x201d; that study the full range of human endeavor and its achievements. The French esprit suggests that spirit has something to do with being fully alive. All these cognates give us some idea why spirit and spirituality resisted being swept into the dictionary&#x2019;s dustbin for obsolete words. They point to something inalienable and central to who we are. They point to that difference, that something more, that makes it possible&#x2014;how did someone put it?&#x2014;for the rubbing of horsehair over gut to come out as Beethoven&#x2019;s First Violin Sonata. They point to that which makes us unique . . . which makes us human.<br> It is also in that dimension we call the human spirit that we experience what we in the West, under the influence of the Judeo-Christian tradition, call the Holy Spirit. That familiar but confusing compound is translated more prosaically as holy wind or holy breath. Because the Hebrew for holy (qadosh) refers to that which is out of the ordinary, Holy Spirit became the way the Hebrew and Christian scriptures talk about God not far off in some seventh heaven but as a mysterious power (like the wind) that is beyond the ordinary and yet experienced as a presence (like the breath we inhale and feel deep within us).<br> Spirituality is about the experience at the core of our beings of something&#x2014; a power, presence, drive, longing&#x2014;that is beyond the ordinary. Defined in this way, spirituality is not about something at the fringes of human life. It is not a leisure-time activity or option for people with a taste for the exotic. It is about what one thoughtful author has called the &#x201c;holy longing&#x201d; or &#x201c;dis-ease&#x201d; (St. Augustine called it a &#x201c;restlessness&#x201d;) at the heart of human life.1 It is about the eros, the energy or drive within us that shapes our actions and ultimately our lives. Seeing spirituality this way makes it a &#x201c;nonnegotiable,&#x201d; more basic than religion:<br> Long before we do anything explicitly religious at all, we have to do something about the fire that burns within us. What we do with that fire, how we channel it, is our spirituality. Thus, we all have a spirituality, whether we want one or not, whether we are religious or not. Spirituality is more about whether or not we can sleep at night than about whether or not we go to church. It is about being integrated or falling apart, about being within community or being lonely, about being in harmony with Mother Earth or being alienated from her.2<br> This view of spirituality is obviously at odds with those who see it as something only for churchgoers or devotees of the paranormal. But does that make it so broad as to become meaningless? Is it an abuse of the word to say that people who do not pray are spiritual? (Whether or not their spirituality is adequate or complete is another question.) But how else do we take people at their word when they say that they are spiritual though not religious? How else do we interpret Albert Einstein, when&#x2014; though not one to frequent a synagogue&#x2014;he tells us that, as a scientist, he wanted to know God&#x2019;s thoughts? How else do we understand Spinoza, the seventeenth-century Dutch philosopher, being regarded both as an atheist and as &#x201c;God-intoxicated&#x201d;? How else do we explain researchers who make their science a religion, or self-styled atheists with a totally selfless commitment to justice? For the prescientific ancients, spirit was what held a body together, keeping it from disintegrating. For us moderns, as individuals or in communities, spirituality can still be a way of talking about what holds us together, what keeps us from disintegrating.<br> Humanism<br> Humanism is another word with a complicated history. But it has an even wider range of possible meanings that, if left unmodified, make it hopelessly ambiguous, some might even say useless. To resolve the difficulty, some authors argue that its unmodified use should be restricted to the eighteenth-century Enlightenment&#x2019;s rejection of religion and to themselves&#x2014; the modern proponents of that rejection&#x2014;who would include signatories of the 1933 and 1973 Humanist Manifestos; the members of various national humanist leagues, such as the American Humanist Association, which publishes The Humanist, and those who agree with the notion that humanism constitutes an alternative to religion with a term less negative than atheism.<br> Atheistic (a.k.a. secular, rational, or ethical) humanists are not the only ones to advocate limiting the word exclusively to themselves. There are conservative Christians of various churches and denominations who happily cede the word to secularists for the sake of having an unambiguous label for the enemy camp. Televangelists of this stripe, for example, blame all that is wrong in America and modern culture&#x2014;from public education to the feminist movement&#x2014;on humanism, regarding it with the same animosity as they do liberalism, their other (or is it the same?) b�te noire.<br> Despite such efforts at simplification, however, humanism remains stubbornly ambiguous. The Oxford English Dictionary offers several different subdefinitions, which one scholar of the word&#x2019;s usage and history finds to be only a fraction of the various senses and contexts in which it has been applied. Its range extends, as he puts it, &#x201c;from the pedantically exact to the cosmically vague.&#x201d; One of those vague but, I would argue, legitimate extended meanings refers to humanism as an evaluation of human achievements and cultivation of human enrichment. But in addition to that nondescript, nonthreatening definition are meanings that carry powerful positive or negative connotations, depending on one&#x2019;s ideological allegiance.3<br> The word, in a word, is loaded. For those who salute it, humanism stands for human freedom and dignity, synonymous with the best of modern Western culture. At the other end of the playing field, postmodern critics of the Enlightenment fault the word for masking its users&#x2019; restriction of full dignity and freedom to a particular race (white), gender (male), and class (fellow aristocrats, landowners, or nationals). Like the Athenian Greeks whom they emulated, the colonial founding fathers who announced American independence with a declaration that &#x201c;all men are created equal&#x201d; owned slaves. In the course of Western history, full humanity at various times has been denied to women, children, those who did not speak Greek (or more recently English), and Jews. For its critics (like Theodor Adorno), the Enlightenment&#x2019;s rationalist, humanist enterprise came to its logical conclusion at Auschwitz. For more recent postmodern critics of the word (Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida), the humanity to which humanism appeals and on which it is based is little more than a pretentious metaphor.<br> That&#x2019;s a lot of baggage for a word first coined to describe an academic reform. In the early nineteenth century, a group of German educators began promoting a curriculum that gave pride of place to what they regarded as the wellsprings of Western civilization and culture, the literary classics and achievements of ancient Greece and Rome. They called their program Humanismus, a word evocative of the Italian Renaissance umanisti, who advocated replacing Aristotle and scholastic theology with the study of Cicero, Virgil, and other Latin and Greek classic texts. The fifteenth- and sixteenth-century umanisti were speech and letter writers for the nobility and ruling magistrates of their day. But they were also the teachers of grammar, rhetoric, history, and ethics, who cultivated what they called&#x2014;borrowing a phrase from Cicero&#x2014;the studia humanitatis, or what today we call the humanities. Needless to say, the word has wandered far beyond the precincts of academe or the fifteenth-century Italian taste for literature.<br> Renaissance humanism will be treated at some length in chapter 2 of this book. Suffice it for now to say that virtually all the Renaissance humanists were practicing Christians. They did not renounce religion or Christian faith. But they did criticize the Latin style and pedagogy of the &#x201c;scholastics,&#x201d; who dominated university faculties at the time. And some humanists could be quite forthright in criticizing the state of the church, clergy, and popular piety, most notable among these being the acerbic priest Erasmus and his friend Thomas More. Both, though critical Catholics, would stoutly rebuff any aspersions cast on their Catholic loyalty or humanist credentials. Other Christians with substantial humanist claims are, to name but a few, Florentine Platonist Pico della Mirandola, Luis Vives and Fray Luis de Le�n in Spain, Jacques Lef�vre d&#x2019;Estaples in France, and John Milton and John Donne in England. The word can also be justifiably ascribed to more recent, though heterogeneous, Christian thinkers such as Gabriel Marcel, Thomas Merton, Paul Tillich, and (Erasmus redivivus?) Hans Kung.4 Obviously humanism cannot be simply identified with irreligion.<br> But what do the ideas and writings of the above Christian humanists have to do with those heroes of secular humanism for whom Christianity and the church were not objects of loyal criticism but contempt? One thinks here of Diderot (for whom Christianity was &#x201c;the Great Prejudice&#x201d;), David Hume (&#x201c;Christian superstition&#x201d;), and Voltaire (&#x201c;�crase l&#x2019;infame&#x201d;). Humanists less polemical but just as averse to all forms of religion were Karl Marx (&#x201c;opium&#x201d; for the oppressed masses) and Sigmund Freud (&#x201c;neurosis&#x201d;). Clearly we have here two very different strains of a bifurcated intellectual tradition, both laying claim to be legitimate heirs of the Renaissance humanists.<br> The genesis of the secular humanist tradition is to be found in the writings of the eighteenth-century British freethinkers and French philosophes who made up what came to be called the &#x201c;Age of Reason&#x201d; or &#x201c;Enlightenment&#x201d; (si�cle de lumi�res; Aufkl�rung).

The message they carried is proof that Jesus was who He said, the Son of God! And these miracles hold great relevance in our lives today. As Dr. Rogers said, &#34;Their purpose is to deepen our trust in Him, not in the miracles themselves.&#34; They serve as signposts pointing to Jesus, showing that He was and is God&#39;s answer to your deepest need - to your disappointments, doubts, disabilities, desires, despair, darkness, and death. This book will change the way you view God and His work in our lives. **** ABOUT THE AUTHOR: For over fifty years, Adrian Rogers preached and championed the Word of God. In that time he became one of America&#39;s most respected Bible teachers presenting the Good News of Jesus Christ with strong conviction, compassion, and integrity. His ministry continues thanks to a rich legacy of sermons, studies, books, booklets, and other resource materials. Through Love Worth Finding, his multimedia ministry, tens of thousands of believers have had their faith strengthened and thousands more have entered into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. His teaching will inspire you to grow in your love of the Lord and service in His kingdom. &#34;And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book: But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through His name.&#34; John 20:30-31</p><p></p><h2>The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade</h2><p>The Diligent began her journey in Brittany in 1731, and Harms follows her along the African coast where her goods were traded for slaves, to Martinique where her captives were sold to work on sugar plantations. Harms brings to life a world in which slavery was a commerce carried out without qualms. He shows the gruesome details of daily life aboard a slave ship, as well as French merchants wrangling with their government for the right to traffic in slaves, African kings waging epic wars for control of European slave trading posts, and representatives of European governments negotiating the complicated politics of the Guinea coast to ensure a stead supply of labor for their countries&#39; colonies. The Diligent is filled with rich stories that explain how the slave trade worked on all levels, from geopolitics to the rigging of ships.</p><p>From the 16th to the 19th century, more than 40,000 slave ships plied the waters of the Atlantic, bringing human cargo to the Americas. Drawing on a memoir by a lieutenant, historian Robert Harms tells the story of one such ship, a story that, although shocking to modern readers, "was distressingly ordinary in its own time and place."<p> Designed to transport grain over short distances, the <i>Diligent</i> was perhaps not the most seaworthy of vessels. Still, by ship's officer Robert Durand's account, it transported nearly 300 victims at a time from the African coast to the French colony of Martinique, often at a terrible cost in life because of disease, malnutrition, and harsh shipboard discipline. Harms carefully reconstructs episodes in the ship's life, including the curious trial that ended its 1731 ocean crossing. More than that, he untangles the complex business of the slave trade, which was far from monolithic, depending instead on ever-shifting alliances and private agendas in the race for profit.</p><p> As Harms notes, though more than 17,000 ships' logs from the slaving voyages of the 18th century have been recovered, only a few shed light on daily life aboard those vessels. His troubling narrative does just that, and it gives new evidence of the ordinariness of evil. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Robert Harms</b> is Professor of History at Yale University.

When commercial air services were launched in 1976, Concorde was hailed as one of the wonders of the technological world. </p><p>Lavishly illustrated throughout, this new edition documents the early difficulties encountered on the way to commercial success as well as examining the tragic event at Gonesse in 2000. With a new section on the after-story of the airplane and a look at what the future holds for supersonic aircraft, this is the definitive book for all Concorde fans.</p></p><p>Christopher Orlebar joined British Airways, then BOAC, in 1969, and he became a Concorde pilot and instructor in 1976, flying the aircraft for 10 years.

Does church seem to hinder more than it helps? Here is a welcoming and realistic guide for all who may be feeling spiritually jaded. Whatever your circumstances, <i>Companions of Christ</i> will show you how to embark on a journey of the heart, starting wherever you happen to be and no matter how unfit for the journey you may feel.<br><br> In <i>Companions of Christ</i> popular British writer Margaret Silf unearths the gold mine of spiritual wisdom to be found in the legacy of Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. Ignatian spirituality sets out an engagingly down-to-earth vision of connecting with God in everyday life. Neither a recipe for a privatized spiritual life nor an agenda imposed by someone else, the Ignatian vision is centered on companionship, which means literally to "share bread" with another. It latches onto God's presence in stories, in other people, in the created universe, and even in God's apparent absence.<br><br> Perfect for those whose faith in God or patience with the church is flagging, <i>Companions of Christ</i> contains very practical teaching on great Ignatian themes -- imaginative scriptural meditation, spiritual discernment, and honest prayer. Incorporating helpful spiritual exercises throughout, Silf shows both tentative and seasoned believers how to keep faith despite the odds.</p><p>Margaret Silf is one of Great Britain&#39;s most popularand successful spirituality writers.

Technology that maimed and killed American boys in Korea and Vietnam.&nbsp;<br> Bridge building to Communist Russia is nothing new. It started early in 1918. With mountains of documentation Mr. Sutton shows that 90 to 95 percent of Soviet technology since 1918 has come from America and its allies . . . that we've built for, or sold, or traded, or given outright to the Communists everything from copper wiring and motor vehicles to combat tanks, missile equipment and computers . . . that &nbsp;we are today &nbsp;giving equipment to build the world 's largest heavy� truck &nbsp;plant &nbsp;(output:&nbsp;100,000 ten-ton &nbsp;trucks per &nbsp;year - more &nbsp;than &nbsp;all &nbsp;U.S. manufacturers produce in a year) . . . that "peaceful trade" is a myth . . . that to the Soviets all goods are strategic. All this, to create and maintain an enemy that we annually spend $80 billion to defend against.<br> <em>National Suicide</em>, researched for over ten years, mentions scores of products passed on to the Soviets (down to the design specifications, in some cases). It fearlessly names the guilty manufacturers and politicians - right up to Presidents of the United States.<br> The government won't like this book. It blows the lid off information that has been kept from the public till now.

Long enough.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re sure about her? Because we can&#x2019;t keep doing this. It wasn&#x2019;t part of the plan, and it&#x2019;s too dangerous. Sooner or later, he&#x2019;s going to figure it out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m trying to prevent. Or at least delay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your job, Sarah. Not the reason you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019; t it? He&#x2019;s getting better at choosing latents. Better at finding them and convincing them to join him. Better than we&#x2019;ve been.&#x201d; Sarah was aware of a niggling unease that was growing rather than diminishing. &#x201c;Speaking of, are we covered?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. My shield&#x2019;s enclosing all three of us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about more-conventional protection?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Galen&#x2019;s got my back. As usual. But once we leave, you&#x2019;re on your own again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019; m not worried about me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sarah&#x2013;&#x201c;<br><br>&#x201c;She could be the one, Bailey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s six years old.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All the more reason. Without the defenses we can teach her, she&#x2019;s vulnerable as hell, especially to someone bent on using her as a weapon.&#x201d;<br><br>Bailey shifted the slight weight of the child and sighed. &#x201c;Look, are you sure you haven&#x2019;t been . . . influenced . . . by what this guy is preaching? All that prophecy stuff?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We believe in prophecy stuff,&#x201d; Sarah reminded her.<br><br>&#x201c;Not the kind he preaches.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah shook her head. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m not a convert. It&#x2019;s all I can do to keep up the facade of a loyal member of the flock.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Many more defections and kids disappearing, and that&#x2019;s going to get a lot harder.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Harder than this?&#x201d; Sarah reached out a hand and lightly touched the child&#x2019;s long blond hair. &#x201c;Her mother is gone. And I haven&#x2019; t seen her father in two days.&#x201d;<br><br>Bailey&#x2019;s mouth tightened. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t include that in the report.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t sure until today. But he&#x2019;s gone. I think he was beginning to ask too many questions. He didn&#x2019;t believe his wife would have just run away, not without their daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was right about that.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah had been expecting it, but the news was still an unwelcome shock.<br>&#x201c;She was found?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A few miles downriver. And she&#x2019;d been in the water awhile, probably since the night she disappeared. No way to determine cause of death.&#x201d;<br><br>Bailey didn&#x2019;t have to explain that further.<br><br>&#x201c;Are the police going to come around asking questions?&#x201d; Sarah asked.<br><br>&#x201c;They have to. Ellen Hodges was known to be a member of the church, and the last time she was seen it was in the company of other church members. Her parents know that, and they&#x2019;re more than willing to point the police in this direction. So if the good Reverend Samuel can&#x2019;t produce Ellen&#x2019;s husband <i>or</i> her child, he&#x2019;s going to have a lot of explaining to do.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah managed a hollow laugh, even as the sense of unease she felt grew stronger. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re assuming the cops who come here won&#x2019;t be church members or paid-off <i>friends</i> of the church.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shit. Are you sure?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;From something I overheard, I&#x2019;m convinced enough that I say it wouldn&#x2019;t be a good idea to take any local law enforcement into our confidence. Not unless somebody on our side can read them very, very well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good enough for me. But Bishop is not going to be happy about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt he&#x2019; ll be surprised. We knew it was a possibility.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Makes the job harder. Or at least a hell of a lot more tricky. Not that it wasn&#x2019;t already, with the town being so isolated and the church so insulated.&#x201d; Bailey shifted the child&#x2019;s weight again. &#x201c;I need to get the kid out of here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wendy. Her name&#x2019;s Wendy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I know. Don&#x2019;t worry, we&#x2019;ll take care of her. She has family who love her and will want her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She also has an ability she&#x2019;s barely aware of.&#x201d; Sarah reached out once more to gently touch the child&#x2019;s hair, then stepped back. &#x201c;Protect her. Protect her gift.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We will. And you watch your back, hear? You&#x2019;ve got a dandy shield of your own, but if it&#x2019;s taking an effort to pretend you could belong here, Samuel or one of his so-called advisers could pick up on the fact that you&#x2019;re hiding more than a bit of doubt about the good reverend and his real agenda.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Believe me, I know.&#x201d; Something cold was spreading through Sarah&#x2019;s body, and she took two more steps back, deliberately removing herself from the other woman&#x2019;s protective shield. &#x201c;Tell Bishop and John that at least one of Samuel&#x2019;s closest advisers is a strong psychic. I&#x2019;ve felt it. Not sure which one; there&#x2019;s nearly always a group of men around him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you were just picking up Samuel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. With Samuel it&#x2019;s just the way it&#x2019;s always been, a . . . null field.

Through her work with George Balanchine, it is also the story of one of the greatest artistic collaborations in dance. . . . An uplifting, splendid memoir."--<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>"An extraordinarily moving story."--<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Farrell's story is not only that of a great dancer but of a great star. . . . this book is important. The subject is great, the views of Balanchine are real and unique."--<i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>Suzanne Farrell, world-renowned ballerina, was one of George Balanchine's most celebrated muses and remains a legendary figure in the ballet world. This memoir, first published in 1990 and reissued with a new preface by the author, recounts Farrell's transformation from a young girl in Ohio dreaming of greatness to the realization of that dream on stages all over the world.&nbsp; Central to this transformation was her relationship with George Balanchine, who invited her to join the New York City Ballet in the fall of 1961 and was in turn inspired by her unique combination of musical, physical, and dramatic gifts. He created masterpieces for her in which the limits of ballet technique were expanded to a degree not seen before.&nbsp; By the time she retired from the stage in 1989, Farrell had achieved a career that is without precedent in the history of ballet. One third of her repertory of more than 100 ballets were composed expressly for her by such notable choreographers as Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Maurice Bejart.&nbsp; Farrell recalls professional and personal attachments and their attendant controversies with a down-to-earth frankness and common sense that complements the glories and mysteries of her artistic achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Suzanne Farrell has staged Balanchine&#x2019;s ballets in New York, Boston, Seattle, and Miami and for the Vienna Opera Ballet, the Kirov, and the Bolshoi. She is the subject of an Academy Award nominated documentary, <i>Suzanne Farrell--Elusive Muse</i>.

In the fall of 2000, the Suzanne Farrell Ballet was launched as an ongoing partnership with the Kennedy Center.</p>Farrell, for years the chief muse of New York City Ballet cofounder and master choreographer George Balanchine, has led an extraordinary, frequently controversial life. Here with former NYCB dancer Bentley, she tells of it with humility, integrity, wit and sophistication. Farrell's is first of all a classically American story of a self-made woman: growing up a tomboy and a dance student in a broken home in Cincinnati, Ohio, she struck out at 15 for Manhattan with her mother and sisters on the chance that she might be accepted into the famed School of American Ballet. Discovered, aesthetically molded and eventually wooed by Russian-born Balanchine, she left NYCB in 1969 after it became apparent that her husband, dancer Paul Mejia, could have no career there so long as Mr. B.'s jealous moods prevailed. Farrell returned to the company in 1974 and retired in 1989 at the age of 44, one of the century's greatest ballerinas. The details of her decades as a dancer vie in interest here with those of her private self; she is both discreet and incisive in her views of on- and offstage events. Photos not seen by PW.

But over the past four decades, the principle of equality before the law has been effectively abolished. Instead, a two-tiered system of justice ensures that the country's political and financial class is virtually immune from prosecution, licensed to act without restraint, while the politically powerless are imprisoned with greater ease and in greater numbers than in any other country in the world.</p><p>Starting with Watergate, continuing on through the Iran-Contra scandal, and culminating with Obama's shielding of Bush-era officials from prosecution, Glenn Greenwald lays bare the mechanisms that have come to shield the elite from accountability. He shows how the media, both political parties, and the courts have abetted a process that has produced torture, war crimes, domestic spying by the NSA, and financial fraud. <br>Cogent, sharp, and urgent, this is a no-holds-barred indictment of a profoundly un-American system that sanctions immunity at the top and mercilessness for everyone else.</p></p><p><b>GLENN GREENWALD</b> is the author of several best sellers, including <i>How Would a Patriot Act?</i> and <i>With Liberty and Justice for Some</i>. Acclaimed as one of the 25 most influential political commentators by <i>The Atlantic</i> and one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers for 2013 by <i>Foreign Policy</i>, Greenwald is a former constitutional law and civil rights attorney. He was a columnist for <i>The Guardian</i> until October 2013, and is now building a new media organization. He is a frequent guest on CNN, MSNBC, and various other television and radio outlets. Greenwald's NSA reporting in 2013 has won numerous awards, including the top investigative journalism award from the Online Journalism Association, the Esso Award for Excellence in Reporting (the Brazilian equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize), and the 2013 Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He was also the recipient of the first annual I.F. Stone Award for Independent Journalism in 2009, and the Online Journalism Association Award in 2010 for his investigative work on the arrest and detention of Bradley Manning. Greenwald is a frequent guest lecturer on college campuses and his work has appeared in many newspapers and political news magazines, including <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>The American Conservative</i>.<p>Introduction</p><p>As a litigator who practiced for more than a decade in federal and state courts across the country, I've long been aware of the inequities that pervade the American justice system. The rich enjoy superior legal representation and therefore much better prospects for success in court than the poor. The powerful are treated with far more deference by judges than the powerless. The same cultural, socioeconomic, and demographic biases that plague society generally also infect the legal process. Few people who have had any interaction with the justice system would dispute this.</p><p>Still, only when I began regularly writing about politics did I realize that the problem extends well beyond such inequities. The issue isn't just that those with political influence and financial power have some advantages in our judicial system. It is much worse than that. Those with political and financial clout are routinely allowed to break the law with no legal repercussions whatsoever. Often they need not even exploit their access to superior lawyers because they don't see the inside of a courtroom in the first place&#x2014;not even when they get caught in the most egregious criminality. The criminal justice system is now almost exclusively reserved for ordinary Americans, who are routinely subjected to harsh punishments even for the pettiest of offenses.</p><p>The wiretapping scandal of 2005 provides a perfect illustration. In December of that year, the <i>New York Times</i> revealed that officials in George W. Bush's administration were eavesdropping on Americans' telephone calls and e-mails without warrants or judicial oversight: a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a ten-thousand-dollar fine for each offense. The lawbreaking could not have been clearer, yet virtually nobody in the political and media class was willing to call those acts "criminal," much less to demand legal investigations or prosecutions.</p><p>This was a depressingly familiar pattern for several decades and became particularly pronounced over the last one. America's political and business establishment presided over a series of extraordinary crimes that brought the United States political disgrace and financial ruin: the creation of a global torture regime; the systematic plundering by Wall Street, leading to the 2008 economic crisis; the serial obstruction of justice by high-ranking political officials; the fraudulent home foreclosures by the nation's largest banks. Yet in almost every instance, the perpetrators were shielded from any legal consequences. As these events clearly demonstrate, America's political culture not only provides strategic advantages in the legal system to political and financial elites, but now actually grants them <i>immunity</i> when they knowingly break the law. This license&#x2014;awarded by the same political class that created the world's largest and most merciless prison state for its poorest and most powerless citizens&#x2014;represents not just a departure from the rule of law but a fundamental repudiation of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The central principle of America's founding was that the rule of law would be the prime equalizing force, the ultimate guardian of justice. The founders considered vast inequality in every other realm to be inevitable and even desirable. Some would be rich, and many would be poor. Some would acquire great power, and many would live their entire lives virtually powerless. A small number of individuals would be naturally endowed with unique and extraordinary talents, while most people, by definition, would be ordinary. Due to those unavoidable circumstances, the American conception of liberty was not only consistent with, but premised on, the inevitability of outcome inequality&#x2014;the success of some people, the failure of others.</p><p>The one exception was the rule of law. When it came to the law, no inequality was tolerable. Law was understood to be the sine qua non ensuring fairness, a level playing field, and a universal set of rules. It was the nonnegotiable prerequisite that made all other forms of inequality acceptable. Only if everyone was bound to the same rules would outcome inequality be justifiable.</p><p>So central is this founding principle that most Americans absorb it by osmosis via numerous clich�s: All are equal before the law. Justice is blind. No man is above the law. We are, in the words of John Adams, "a nation of laws, not men." For Adams, either the law is supreme in all cases, or the arbitrary will of rulers is. Adams and the other founders viewed the preeminence of law over individuals&#x2014;all individuals&#x2014;as the only protection against the tyranny that American colonists had launched a revolution to abolish. For that reason, American political liberty was always inextricably bound to the notion that law reigns supreme.</p><p>It would be difficult to overstate the essential place of the rule of law in the American political tradition. A principal grievance against King George III was his unilateral power to vest in himself and those he favored the right to act outside of the law. The goal of the American Revolution was to replace this arbitrary will of the monarch with unbending equal application of law to everyone. "Where, say some, is the King of America?" Thomas Paine, the great American revolutionary, asked in his 1776 pamphlet <i>Common Sense</i>. His answer:</p><p>Let a crown be placed thereon, by which the world may know, that so far as we approve of monarchy, that in America the Law is King. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other.</p><p>Alexander Hamilton did not often see eye to eye with Paine, but on this he heartily agreed. "The instruments by which [government] must act are either the AUTHORITY of the laws or FORCE," he wrote in 1794. "If the first be destroyed, the last must be substituted; and where this becomes the ordinary instrument of government there is an end to liberty!" Like Paine and Hamilton, Adams, in his 1776 <i>Thoughts on Government,</i> put the rule of law at the top of his list of core principles for a free and legitimate government: "The very definition of a republic is &#x2018;an empire of laws, and not of men.' . . . Good government is an empire of laws."</p><p>That last line may at first glance appear simple and even trite, but it contains a critical insight. The supremacy of law is not just one among many instruments of good government; it <i>is</i> good government itself. The converse is equally true: in the absence of the rule of law, good government cannot be said to exist.</p><p>To be sure, there may be exceptional situations where the rule of men might produce better outcomes than the rule of law. A truly magnanimous tyrant, a benevolent dictator, might conceivably lead to more positive results than a regime of unjust laws rigidly applied. Historians can point to emperors who exercised absolute power while advancing the interests of their subjects and the territories they ruled. Nevertheless, such societies should not be confused with "good government," dependent as they are on the fortuitous emergence of an unrestrained leader who is both well-intentioned and relatively immune from the corrupting effects of power (and, even less plausibly, immune from the absolutely corrupting effects of absolute power). A country that prospers by vesting absolute power in a leader who happens to be benevolent could just as easily come under the control of a malevolent leader the next time around. And when that happens, as at some point it surely will, a society without the rule of law will have no means of redress short of violent revolution.</p><p>What's more, even the most well-intentioned leader will eventually abuse his power if he is not constrained by law. Indeed, and somewhat paradoxically, a ruler's belief in his own virtue actually renders abuses of power more likely, since he can rationalize all manner of arbitrary and capricious measures: <i>I am good and </i><i>doing this for good ends, and it is therefore justifiable</i>. Power exercised corruptly inevitably degrades and destroys even genuinely benevolent intent.</p><p>The founders understood that magnanimity is very rarely an enduring safeguard against the corrupting influences of power, and because they understood this, they insisted on the rule of law as the only effective weapon against such temptations. "Why has government been instituted at all?" Hamilton asked in <i>Fed</i><i>eralist 15</i>. "Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint." Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1798: "In questions of power, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution." Adams, in 1772, put it this way: "There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty." Four years later, his wife, Abigail, memorably echoed the same sentiment in a letter to him: "Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could."</p><p>The rule of law does not guarantee good government: an empire of unjust laws can be as tyrannical as an empire of men, perhaps even more so. But though the rule of law is not <i>sufficient</i> by itself to ensure a just and free society, it's absolutely <i>necessary</i> for it. For that reason, a nation that renounces the rule of law has rendered tyranny not only likely but inevitable.</p><p>The fundamental requirement of the rule of law is equality: the uniform application of a set of preexisting rules to everyone, including the rulers. But like the term <i>rule of law, equality under the law</i> has become merely a platitude, a phrase recited without much appreciation of its significance. Everyone claims to believe in it, but hardly anyone remembers what it means. And yet the demand that all be treated equally under the law was no secondary concept to the founding of the United States, but its crux, and it is not difficult to understand why.</p><p>What the founders feared most was that a centr...</p></p><h2>The Lies They Tell</h2><p><p><b>Welcome to the real America,<br>a place you call home but don't yet know!</b></p> <p> The USA is the world's empire and its actions will influence us all for generations to come. <br><b>But who are the Americans, the people who make up America?</b> </p><p> Tuvia Tenenbom travels through America to find out. His wanderings take him across regional frontiers, partisan lines, and socioeconomic boundaries in a fearless quest for the flesh-and-blood American. He visits black ghettos and white gated communities, megachurches and Indian reservations. He schmoozes with robbers who teach him the true meaning of love and meets Jews who dedicate day and night to hatred of their brethren. He finagles his way into a prison where skinheads pray, goes to the Senate where no Senator seems to be working, experiments with drugs on American streets and ponders the deeper meaning of life with rednecks. He mingles with soldiers who teach him how to invade foreign countries and intellectuals who teach him the beautiful nature of Mother Earth, the goodness of man, and the sadism of the Israeli. The characters he encounters, the adventures he eagerly embraces and the findings of his journey are always unique and often unexpected. <b>Welcome to the real America, a place you call home but don't yet know.</b></p></p><p>Tuvia Tenenbom, the author of three bestsellers in a row, is a journalist, dramatist, and the founder of the Jewish Theater of New York. Tuvia studied for his doctorate in English literature at St. John&#39;s University, earned his MFA in playwriting at CUNY-Brooklyn, received his BS in mathematics and computer science from Touro, and finished his rabbinical studies in Jerusalem. He also studied Christianity and Islam in Israel and New York as well as journalism, acting, theater, and finance (at NYU).<b>Israeli-German journalist Tenenbom <b>(Catch the Jew!)</b> employs his not-so-subtle sarcasm to expose the hypocrisy, contradictions, and delusions of average Americans.</b> Following his assessment of Europeans in his previous books, he now endeavors to meet as many people as possible and portray the character [of America] and its people.He begins his journey in June 2015, the day of the Charleston, S.C., church shooting, and ends after the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting in December 2015. <b>He encounters propaganda and denial, and exposes political corruption in Chicago, gun culture, megachurches, anti-Semitism, polarizing opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, vanishing Native American culture, proud rednecks intimidating African-Americans and Muslims, and climate-change deniers denigrating intellectuals.</b> He reveals the hypocrisy of a nation where international aid organizations are well funded and $30 million is raised for a Catholic shrine in Wisconsin, yet devastated neighborhoods in Detroit and Chicago get nothing. His outlook may be bleak, but it's hard not to share his incredulity at the levels of laughable self-delusion. For instance, a guide at the Henry Ford Museum in Detroit disavows Ford's anti-Semitism, saying, Here we talk only about positive stuff, not about problems. <b>Brutal, irreverent, and cutting, Tenenbom's riveting book aims to disrupt American complacency.

And, in truth, what else is there? Being is multiple and comprises many states, both manifest and unmanifest; but the unmanifest has precedence, what is seen being effectively nothing in the face of what is not seen. To realize this is to realize the contingency of the human state and the set of its inherent possibilities; to realize the contingency of the human state is to be liberated from it; to be liberated from the human state is to assimilate the principle by which the being can be liberated from all states. This is the end of the spiritual life, and also of the human form: &#39;end&#39; both as telos and as annihilation. And since all beings in manifestation exist equally and simultaneously in all the planes and states of the Unmanifest, to know Infinite Possibility is precisely to become what one is. Whatever else Gu�non wrote, as mystagogue, hermeneut, critic of the modern world, emanated from and existed to support the realization of only This.</p><p>Ren� Gu�non (1886&#x2013;1951) was one of the great luminaries of the twentieth century, whose critique of the modern world has stood fast against the shifting sands of intellectual fashion. His extensive writings, now finally available in English, are a providential treasure-trove for the modern seeker: while pointing ceaselessly to the perennial wisdom found in past cultures ranging from the Shamanistic to the Indian and Chinese, the Hellenic and Judaic, the Christian and Islamic, and including also Alchemy, Hermeticism, and other esoteric currents, they direct the reader also to the deepest level of religious praxis, emphasizing the need for affiliation with a revealed tradition even while acknowledging the final identity of all spiritual paths as they approach the summit of spiritual realization. Ren� Gu�non, of whom Jacob Needleman wrote in The Sword of Gnosis that &#x2018;no other modern writer has so effectively communicated the absoluteness of truth,&#x2019; is gradually being recognized by deeper thinkers as one of the few who have truly penetrated the seductive veil of the modern age. As an expositor of pure metaphysics and its application to the science of symbols, Gu�non is without peer; and his extraordinarily prescient critique of the modern world is attracting more and more attention among cultural commentators. Little known in the English-speaking world till the recent appearance of his Collected Works in translation, Gu�non has nevertheless long been recognized as a veritable criterion of truth by a vanguard of remarkable writers who evince that rare combination: intellectuality and spirituality. After a lonely childhood, often interrupted by ill health, Gu�non navigated the seductive half-truths of occultism toward a deeper, unified vision offering a way out from the confusion and fragmentation of our time. Regarded by leading scholars as the first truly authentic interpreter of many Eastern doctrines in the West, Gu�non never tired, in face of the seemingly inexorable process of dissolution in the twentieth century, of pointing to the transcendent unity of all religious faiths and the abiding Truth that contains them all.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Cursed Hermit (Hobtown Mystery Stories, 2)</h2><p><p>Praise for <em>The Case of the Missing Men</em>:</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Bertin&#x2019;s confident, idiosyncratic tone and Forbes&#x2019; small, unnerving, almost Jack Chick&#x2013;like art that makes this such a weirdly warm-hearted nightmare.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em> (Starred Review)</p><p>&#x201c;This debut would be impressive enough as a mere genre exercise&#x2015;the perceptive insights into the weirdly hermetic lives of both teenagers and small towns alike, then, are almost a bonus.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>The<br><br>Globe and Mail</em></p><p>Will our Teen Detectives untangle the mystery of Knotty Pines&#x2015;before it&#x2019;s too late?

We know some of the answers, because half of George Armstrong Custer&#x2019;s Seventh Cavalry - the men with Major Marcus Reno and Captain Frederick Benteen - survived the fight, but what of the half that did not, the troopers, civilians, scouts, and journalist who were with Custer?</p><p>Now, because a grass fire in August 1983 cleared the terrain of brush and grass and made possible thorough archaeological examinations of the battlefield in 1984 and 1985, we have many answers to important questions.</p><p>On the basis of the archaeological evidence presented in this book, we know more about what kinds of weapons were used against the cavalry. We know exactly where many of the men fought, how they died, and what happened to their bodies at the time of or after death. We know how the troopers were deployed, what kind of clothing they wore, what kind of equipment they had, how they fought. Through the techniques of historical archaeology and forensic anthropology, the remains and grave of one of Custer&#x2019;s scouts, Mitch Boyer, have been identified. And through geomorphology and the process of elimination, we know with almost 100 percent certainty where the twenty-eight missing men who supposedly were buried en masse in Deep Ravine will be found.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Douglas D.

The worldwide prominence of snakes in religion, myth, and folklore underscores our deep connection to the serpent&#x2015;but why, when so few of us have firsthand experience? The surprising answer, this book suggests, lies in the singular impact of snakes on primate evolution. Predation pressure from snakes, Lynne Isbell tells us, is ultimately responsible for the superior vision and large brains of primates&#x2015;and for a critical aspect of human evolution. </p><p>Drawing on extensive research, Isbell further speculates how snakes could have influenced the development of a distinctively human behavior: our ability to point for the purpose of directing attention. A social activity (no one points when alone) dependent on fast and accurate localization, pointing would have reduced deadly snake bites among our hominin ancestors. It might have also figured in later human behavior: snakes, this book eloquently argues, may well have given bipedal hominins, already equipped with a non-human primate communication system, the evolutionary nudge to point to communicate for social good, a critical step toward the evolution of language, and all that followed.</p></p><p>Lynne A. Isbell is Professor of Anthropology and Animal Behavior at the University of California, Davis.With this fascinating book, which will certainly challenge many views accepted by&nbsp;the current generation of primate specialists, Isbell has provided the basis for far-reaching&nbsp;reinterpretations of the origins of our distinctive intelligence accompanied by seemingly&nbsp;irrational and emotional processes.&nbsp;<br>--Gordon M.

Harvested by an eminent expert from an ancient oral tradition, these sacred stories introduce wily tricksters, fearsome giants, timorous tree spirits, seductive maidens, and wise grandmothers. Here, a coward masquerading as a hero becomes one; a powerful warrior is riled and routed by a younger sibling with a gift for dancing and disguises; and the ever-hungry evil weendigos--evil manitous--haunt the land. In spellbinding and hypnotic fashion, the creation and flood legends are told, and the origin stories of corn, spruce, and tobacco are revealed.

For Ray, it is a story of linking the ecology of people with the ecology of place &#x2014; of recovering lost traditions as she works to restore the fractured ecosystem of her native South. Her story is filled with syrup boils, quilt making, alligator trapping, and the wonderful characters of a place where generations still succeed each other on the land. But her town is also in need of repair, physical and otherwise. Ray works to save her local school, sets up a writing group at the local hardware store, and struggles with whether she can be an adult in a childhood place.</p><p>"...a satisfying ending to her bizarre and readable story..alive with good imagery and colorful characters..." -- <i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 18, 2003</i><br><br>"A wonderful book of one woman's effort to come to terms with herself...Ray has written another must-read book..." -- <i>Tulsa World, July 27, 2003</i><br><br>"Ray's honest, straightforward style resonates with unassuming power, sweeping readers along like a great current in a broad river." -- <i>Orlando Sentinel, June 22, 2003</i><br><br>"clear-eyed, lyrical descriptions...This is nature writing at its best...Her book will make you long for home." -- <i>St. Petersburg Times, June 22, 2003</i><br><br>Ray&#x2019;s ruminations on hope, community and sustainable living is highly recommended for public libraries and regional collections. -- <i>Library Journal</i><br><br>This is the story of [Janisse Ray&#x2019;s] &#x2018;long road home again,&#x2019; a triumph of the best in her poetic spirit. -- <i>Bellingham Herald, April 27, 2003</i></p><h2>Puss &#39;n Cahoots: A Mrs. Murphy Mystery</h2><p>Instead of a proper second honeymoon, the newly remarried Harry and Fair Haristeen leave cozy Crozet, Virginia, for Shelbyville, Kentucky, site of the famous saddlebred horse show. There they&#x2019;ll visit dear friends Joan Hamilton and Larry Hodge and enjoy a week among some of the finest horses, trainers, and riders in the country.<br><br> But soon after they arrive, events veer mysteriously&#x2013;and murderously&#x2013;off course. First, Joan&#x2019;s ruby and sapphire horsehead heirloom pin is stolen from her private box at the fairgrounds. Next, a young film star&#x2019;s prize three-gaited mare disappears into thin air. There is no lack of suspects, from hotheaded trainers and jealous rivals to vicious ex-spouses. Then a body is found flagrantly murdered and it&#x2019;s obvious to Harry that someone at Shelbyville is sending a strong message: winning is only secondary&#x2013;first prize is survival.<br><br> As Harry searches for clues, rediscovers life as a married woman, and deals with her upcoming fortieth birthday, her four-legged detective friends are already on the case. But is animal instinct any match for human depravity? Especially with two humans to protect and a killer on the prowl?</p><p><b>Rita Mae Brown&nbsp;</b>is the bestselling author of the Sneaky Pie Brown series; the Sister Jane series;&nbsp;<i>A Nose for Justice&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Murder Unleashed; Rubyfruit Jungle; In Her Day;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Six of One,&nbsp;</i>as well as several other novels.

At six p.m., the grassy parking lot of the famous fairgrounds accepted a steady stream of spectators. By seven p.m., the lot would be overflowing and the shift to backup parking would begin. A soft breeze carried a hint of moisture from the Ohio River about twenty-five miles west, which separated the state of Kentucky from Indiana. Barn swallows swooped through the air to snare abundant insects, as crows, perched on overhead lines, watched, commenting on everything. Cattle dotted pastures. Butterflies swarmed the horse droppings at the fairgrounds. While butterflies liked flowers and flowering bushes, they also evidenced a strong fondness for manure. Each time a maintenance man dutifully picked up the manure, a cloud of yellow swallowtails, black swallowtails, milk butterflies, and small bright blue butterflies swirled up from their prize. No matter how lowly their feeding habits, it was a beautiful sight.<br><br><i>"If I weren't in this blasted collar, I'd snatch one</i>,<i>"</i> Pewter bragged. <i>"Maybe two."</i><br><br><i>"They are tempting,"</i> Mrs. Murphy agreed with the fat gray cat. Mrs. Murphy, a sleek tiger cat, was carried by Harry Haristeen. Pewter was carted by Fair Haristeen, DVM. The cats eagerly awaited the beginning of the first night's competition.<br><br>Shelbyville, the second glittering jewel in the Saddlebred world, attracted the best horses in the country. The show commenced a full two weeks before the Kentucky State Fair, the blowout of Saddlebred shows.<br><br>The four jewels in the crown were the Lexington Junior League, Shelbyville, the Kentucky State Fair at Louisville, and the Kansas City Royal, the only big show held in late fall, November. All the others were summer shows.<br><br>Throughout America, but most especially in Kentucky, Indiana, and Missouri, the Saddlebred shows added sparkle to the season and coins to the coffers. Every town bigger than a minute hosted one, no matter how humble. No one ever accused the Shelbyville show of being humble. A grandstand encircled the immaculate show ring oval. Most of the seating area was covered. The south of the lighted ring was anchored by an imposing two-story grandstand, where food was served if one had a ticket for the feast.<br><br>The aroma of the ribs tortured Tucker, the corgi, walking between her two humans. She drooled with anticipation. "How long before we eat?"<br><br><i>"I don't know, but I could faint with hunger."</i> Pewter sighed.<br><br><i>"Oh la."</i> Mrs. Murphy thought to say more but realized if she started a fight she would unceremoniously be taken back to their suite at the Best Western hotel.<br><br>Harry and Fair paused to watch horses being worked in the practice ring on the east side of the fairgrounds. Booty Pollard, a famous forty-one-year-old trainer with a fully dressed monkey perching on his shoulder, walked next to a junior riding a three-gaited country pleasure horse. The walk, trot, canter horse was one of those wonderful creatures that take care of their young rider. Fortunately for the junior, this mare's three gaits were smooth. They were leaving the ring. Booty turned his head upon hearing another trainer raise his voice.<br><br>Charles "Charly" Trackwell, a big-money trainer and a peacock, shouted at a stunning young woman on an equally stunning chestnut three-gaited horse, Queen Esther. Queen Esther was much fancier than the country pleasure horse Booty's junior was riding. Queen Esther's trot just threw the beautiful woman up out of the saddle. Renata DeCarlo had paid two hundred fifty thousand dollars for the mare. Renata meant to win. She had to work harder than other competitors for the judges to take her seriously, but she liked hard work as much as she liked winning. At thirty-eight&#x2013;although her "official" bio shaved six years off that age saying she was thirty-two&#x2013;she was a movie star and there weren't many stars bred in Lincoln County, Kentucky. While everyone wanted to look at her, spectators and judges could be prejudiced. Envy from others found odd ways of expressing itself. Renata often received a ribbon lower than she should have earned. Her gorgeous mare merited being pinned first, the blue ribbon, more often than not. Shortro, her young gray stalwart three-gaited gelding, also endured lower pinnings than was fair.<br><br>But Shortro, unlike Queen Esther, was happy if he won a blue, red, yellow, green, white, pink ribbon. Queen Esther always wanted the huge best-in-class ribbon, as did Renata.<br><br>Horses, like people, are fully fledged personalities.<br><br>"Relax your shoulders, Renata," Charly growled.<br><br>"Beautiful," Harry commented.<br><br>"Fabulous mare." Fair prudently focused on the chestnut mare, which made Harry laugh.<br><br>They passed the white barn closest to the practice ring, the silver tin roof showing some wear and tear. The old barns might need a coat of paint, unlike the grandstand, but they were airy and quite pleasant. The number of competitors was so great that tent barns had been thrown up to handle the overflow. Each day hundreds of horses competed, some being driven in, vanned, for that day only. Keeping track of what horses were on the grounds proved overwhelming sometimes, because not every horse was competing. Some were companion horses to keep the star horse company. The temporary stalls, bisected by two aisles, were also completely full. The great stables marked off one or even two stalls for a hospitality suite, which would be outfitted with canvas panels and drapes in the stable's colors. Many boasted a tented ceiling inside to further enhance the welcoming atmosphere. An open bar and refreshments added to the festival atmosphere. Directors' chairs&#x2013;again in the stable colors&#x2013;tack trunks, bridle cases, ribbons hanging on the "walls," as well as lovely photographs of clients and horses completed the setting. The labor that it took to create these oases of cheer, along with another stall made into a special changing room for the riders, often behind the hospitality room, amazed Harry each time she visited one of the big Saddlebred shows, which she did once a year. Although a passionate Thoroughbred woman, she loved the Saddlebred. She'd trained a few from Kalarama Farm to be foxhunters. Saddlebreds could jump, really jump, which delighted Harry. The Thoroughbred, with its sloping shoulder and lower head carriage, ideally has a long, fluid stride. The Saddlebred's energy is expended upward, high stepping with some reach, and the head is held high. Go back one hundred fifty years and the two different breeds share some common ancestors.<br><br>Joan Hamilton, one of Harry's best friends, was the driving force behind the breeding program at Kalarama Farm. Her husband, Larry Hodge, trained and also rode many of the horses. As often happens in the horse world, when the right two people find each other, a magic glow shines on everything they touch.<br><br>On the way to the Kalarama ringside box, Harry and Fair strolled the midway crammed with a lot of stuff you'd like to buy and a lot of stuff you wouldn't. The jewelry shop tempted Harry. She stopped to admire a ring with square-cut rubies and diamonds set in a horseshoe. It was the most beautiful horseshoe ring she'd ever seen.<br><br>The ubiquitous funnel cakes cast their special doughy scent over the area, as did hot dogs, ribs, slabs of beef, and delicious chicken turning on a spit. The food shops, jewelry shop, and clothing shops were interspersed with people from the local farm bureau and various civic organizations running the booths, all having a good time. Most of the civic booths were under the grandstand facing the midway. A gleaming SL55 Mercedes lured folks to buy raffle tickets, one hundred bucks a pop, proceeds going to charity. Flattening your wallet proved all too easy walking along this small, seductive thoroughfare.<br><br>The uncovered western grandstand loomed over one side of the midway, and there were booths under it, as well. Everywhere you looked, right or left of the short midway, there was a booth. Right in front of the western grandstand, smack on the rail, were boxes, with six or eight folding chairs inside. These, rented by the great stables, were magnets for the spectators. Riders, breeders, and owners usually repaired to their boxes, which unlike the rented stalls did not bear the stable colors but sported a chaste white rectangular sign with the name of the box owner in simple black Roman letters.<br><br>Joan leaned forward to talk to her mother, the diminutive, lively Frances, and her father, Paul, as they checked their programs. Paul was one of those people who exerted a warm charisma, drawing people to him. Neither of the elder Hamiltons ever met a stranger.<br><br>Harry stepped into the box, Mrs. Murphy in her arms. Fair, Pewter, and Tucker immediately followed.<br><br>After hugs and kisses all around, everyone settled in their seats. Cookie, Joan's brown-and-white Jack Russell, squeezed with Tucker on a seat.<br><br>When Harry and Fair had arrived yesterday, they viewed Joan's yearlings, mares, and colts, and watched Larry work the horses. Harry learned from watching Larry, who knew exactly when to stop the lesson. So many trainers overtrained, the result being the horse grew sour or flat. Since a Saddlebred must show with brio, overtraining proved a costly mistake.<br><br>Frances, wearing a peach linen and silk dress with a corsage, turned to her daughter and said, "Joan, did you show the newlyweds Harlem's Dreamgirl?"<br><br>"Yes, I did."<br><br>Paul, a twinkle in his eye, twisted in his seat to wink at Fair. "You got the dreamgirl."<br><br>Fair slapped the older but still powerfully built World War II Navy vet on the shoulder. "I think we both married our dreamgirls."<br><br>"Paul and I married in the Dark Ages." Frances laughed.<br><br>"Still a honeymoon," Paul gallantly said.<br><br>Joan took off her beige silk jacket as the heat bore down. A gorgeous pin, a ruby and sapphire riding crop intertwined through a sparkling horseshoe, graced the left lapel.<br><br>"Joan, did you fix the clasp on that pin?" Frances asked.<br><br>"Yes, I did, and it's tight as a tick."<br><br>"Good. You know I think that's the prettiest piece of my mother's jewelry."<br><br>Joan, knowing her mother wouldn't be satisfied until she had examined the pin, slipped her coat off the chair, handing it to her mother.<br><br>Turning the lapel back, Frances fingered the pin. "Well, that should hold it." Before handing it back to Joan, she noted the careful work the jeweler had performed. "You know that's our lucky pin. You wear it when it counts, but always on the last night of the show."<br><br>Everyone studied their programs.<br><br>"Third class has that movie star in it." Paul read down the list.<br><br>The third class was the adult three-gaited show pleasure.<br><br>"She's going to have a tough time beating Melinda Falwell." Joan folded back her program.<br><br>"Booty's client." Paul named Melinda's trainer, a gregarious man still recovering from a sulfurous divorce last year. The recovery was financial as well as emotional. It was Booty who Harry and Fair had seen walking out of the practice ring.<br><br>Five years ago an intense rivalry set off fireworks in the Saddlebred world as the old guard began to retire or die off, leaving the younger men and a few women in their middle years to come forward in a big way. Larry Hodge, Booty Pollard, and Charly Trackwell had taken up where Tom Moore, Earl Teater, and the late Bradshaw brothers had left off. Pushing behind Larry, Booty, and Charly were men and more women than in previous generations, in their late twenties and early thirties, one of whom, Ward Findley, evidenced special talent.<br><br>Saddlebred trainers rode the difficult horses or the horses in the big classes, which would add thousands of dollars to the horse's worth if the animal showed well. In the Thoroughbred world, trainers did not ride in the races. Here they did, which gave the shows an extra dimension. It was as if Bill Parcells played quarterback or Earl Weaver stepped up to the plate.<br><br>The amateur riders, coached by the trainers, didn't necessarily ride easy horses, but usually the horses were more tractable and less was at stake. A win at one of the big shows could send a horse's value skyrocketing. Few people are immune to that incentive, hence the enduring appeal of the trainer/rider.<br><br>Ward Findley, who was twenty-nine and had close-cropped, jet-black hair and sparkling blue eyes, quickly came up to the Kalarama box, leaned over, and whispered to Joan, "You'd better get to the barn." Right behind Ward came Booty Pollard, his pet monkey on his shoulder. "Trouble," Ward continued. The monkey, Miss Nasty, chattered as she peered at everyone in the box. Miss Nasty loved Booty, but she hated his snake collection, which he kept at home. She, at least, got to travel. Fortunately, the snakes did not. Booty did have peculiar tastes in pets.<br><br>Paul, overhearing, stood up.<br><br>"Daddy, you stay here. People need to see you and Mom." Joan was already out of the box.<br><br>Fair, an equine vet, followed her. Kalarama had their regular vet, but he didn't attend the shows. The organizers kept a vet on the premises so there was no need for each competitor or breeder to tie up their own vet for the four evenings of the show.<br><br>Not to be left behind, Harry scooped up both cats, her progress slowed by the two unhappy kitties squirming in her arms.<br><br><i>"If you'd put me down, I could follow just fine,"</i> Mrs. Murphy complained.<br><br><i>"She thinks you'll run off,"</i> Tucker, excited by the tension in the humans, commented.<br><br><i>"You're a big, fat help,"</i> Mrs. Murphy growled.<br><i><br>"I'm a dog. I'm obedient. You're a cat. You're not."</i> Tucker relished the discomfort of her two friends, since they often lorded over her.<br><br>The conversation abruptly ended as they reached Barn Five, where three horses were being led into the barn, Charly Trackwell trotting after them, his face grim. They were not Joan's horses.<br><br><i>"Isn't that the chestnut mare from the practice ring?"</i> Pewter studied the gleaming animal, her long neck graceful.<br><br><i>"Yes."</i> Mrs. Murphy was happy when Harry unhitched Pewter's and her leash and quickly deposited them in the hospitality room. Pewter used the opportunity to jump onto the table, snatching a succulent square of ham.<br><br>"You're a goddamned diva!" Charly shouted at Renata DeCarlo, who stormed ahead of Charly.<br><br>The loss of board and training fees for three horses would hurt Charly a bit, but the real blow was losing his movie-star client.<br><br>Joan prudently stood by a stall, since Charly now faced Larry, Renata to Larry's side. Fair stood behind Larry.<br><br>"I'm sick of you shouting at me, Charly." Renata, face flushed, was remarkably calm.<br><br>Charly turned to Larry. "You're behind this, Hodge. You've been trying to steal Renata away from me since she came to my barn."<br><br>"That's not true." Larry kept his voice level.<br><br>"You love the glamour. And you'll make a bloody fortune. You always do." Charly, shaking with rage, stepped toward Larry.<br><br>Renata grabbed Charly's arm, which he threw off. "You've criticized me one time too many. You're an egotistical shit and I'm sick of it."<br><br>Much as he wanted to hit her and Larry, too, Charly managed to control himself. He stopped breathing for a second, then gulped air. "Renata, you redefine the word 'ego.' "<br><br>"We can all sort this out tomorrow when everybody has calmed down," Larry sensibly suggested.<br><br>"The hell with you." Then Charly wheeled on Renata and pointed his finger right in her face. "I know about you." With that he turned on his booted heel and left.</p><h2>Old Mother West Wind: The Centennial Anniversary Edition (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>It's been a century since readers first ventured into the Green Forest to encounter Reddy Fox, Grandfather Frog, Jimmy Skunk, and other winsome characters.

A nineteen year old girl named Sunshine, a member of the small community, mysteriously disappears one evening. She was last seen hiking from her residence into an oncoming September thunderstorm. Orin, the leader of the commune, organizes a small search party the next morning to look for her. They discover Sunshine about a mile from the commune, dead by strangulation. Deputy Sheriff Manny Rivera arrives at the crime scene and begins his investigation. He looks around at the vast empty terrain, wondering why anyone would kill a seemingly innocent young lady out in the middle of nowhere. The other residents of the commune, an unusual collection of drop-outs from society, are all potential suspects. Rivera&#39;s pursuit of the killer introduces the reader to the commune and its bizarre history, a strange backcountry hermit who lives in a camper-top pickup truck, and a picturesque ranch overlooking Labyrinth Canyon owned by a wealthy well-connected third-generation rancher. Rivera receives assistance in his investigation from Amy Rousseau, PhD, an attractive botanist who is quickly becoming his love interest. Rivera conducts his investigation while dealing with problems caused by his inexperienced new boss, Sheriff Denny Campbell. In the end, the deputy&#39;s own life is endangered as he gets closer to understanding the motive for Sunshine&#39;s murder.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Author's Website: &nbsp; richcurtinnovels.com&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perceptive storytelling energized by an admirable protagonist and refined prose."&nbsp;<i>--Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;on<i>&nbsp;Artifacts of Death</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... a riveting read of desert drama and mystery, very much recommended."<i>--Midwest Book Review</i>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<i>Artifacts of Death</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;"...

So why can't she find a date? Men flock to her at parties when they think she's a dumb blonde. But, as soon as they realize she's a Harvard-educated lawyer, they flee. Harper's best friend is a magazine editor who suggests Harper go on assignment for a month as a 'dumb blonde' and see if it changes her dating perspective. So, for two weeks, Harper goes undercover. She changes her wardrobe, her conversation, her body language. The result is a series of comical encounters. Soon, Harper must take a good look in the mirror and realize that it's not just men who judge people on their looks.</p><p>Kristin Harmel is the author of four women's fiction novels. She also reports for <em>People</em> magazine, and her work has appeared in magazines including <em>Glamour</em>, <em>Runner's World</em>, <em>Woman's Day</em>, <em>American Baby</em>, and <em>Men's Health</em>. She's also the author of two novels for teens. Kristin Harmel lives in Orlando, Florida.In her follow-up to <i>How to Sleep with a Movie Star</i>, Harmel, a chick lit reviewer for morning television show <i>The Daily Buzz</i>, nails the formula: girl can't get guy, girl employs zany tactics, girl gets string of lame guys, girl learns about herself. Harper Roberts is a brilliant 35-year-old New York patent attorney who hasn't had a satisfying relationship in three years. So when her girlfriends dare her to test the "Blonde Theory" as fodder for a magazine article, Harper takes the bait and agrees to spend two weeks as not just a blonde (which she is), but as a ditsy blonde, complete with skimpy clothes and a stunted vocabulary. She quickly rounds up dates with men who think she is either a cheerleader or a bartender, and she also connects with Matt, a dreamy soap opera actor who knows the real Harper. Assuming he is as superficial as the men ditsy Harper is dating, smart Harper doesn't believe his attentions are genuine. In the meantime, she receives sage advice from her (cute) plumber. This book isn't a life-changer, but it is a nice time killer. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The issue of difficulty in life is at the very essence of Buddhism. The first noble truth could certainly be translated as "life is full of difficulties." And the remaining noble truths could be seen as Buddhism&#x2019;s analysis of our difficulties and of a path to working with them. Celebrated Buddhist teachers Sylvia Boorstein, Zoketsu Norman Fisher, and Tsoknyi Rinpoche use their diverse wisdom to address the immediate and practical concerns in our lives and to explore the most basic and profound questions of Buddhism: the difficulty of life in general and how we can work with that and ameliorate it.<br><br>Filled with humor and personal stories, Solid Ground offers specific teachings for concrete situations as well as a way to explore the larger questions of finding equanimity in difficult times.</p><p>Sylvia Boorstein: Sylvia Boorstein, teaches mindfulness and leads retreats across the United States.

What can Christians do about it? In the last ten years the New Age has shifted out of the counterculture into the mainstream of society. Today its effects are felt in almost every aspect of life--medicine, politics, science, psychology and even religion. --Fortune 500 corporations routinely send their managers to New Age seminars to expand their minds and increase productivity. --Entertainer Shirley MacLaine has written two best-selling books that chronicle her conversion to the New Age. --Doctors and therapists increasingly employ healing techniques that are based on pantheistic principles. --Even advertisers on radio and television, in tune with New Age ideas, are telling us that we have unlimited potential. Douglas Groothuis explains how the New Age combines Eastern mysticism with Western optimism and why it has become so popular. His thorough, biblical analysis helps Christians know how to respond to this aggressive movement.</p><p>Douglas R. Groothuis (PhD, Philosophy, University of Oregon) is professor of philosophy at Denver Seminary in Denver, Colorado. He has also been a visiting professor or adjunct faculty member at Fuller Theological Seminary (Colorado Springs extension), Metropolitan State College of Denver, Westminster Theological Seminary (California campus), University of Oregon, New College Berkeley and Seattle Pacific University.

On the day of their wedding, the bride and groom were attended by a fantastical procession of well-wishers: the Spoon Lickers, the Tin Pan Bangers, the Easy Ticklers, the Musical Soup Eaters, and other whimsical characters, all marching along in a manner befitting their extraordinary names. <br>This tale of wedding pomp and madcap mirth comes from poet Carl Sandburg's classic book of American fairy tales, <i>The Rootabaga Stories.</i> Marvelous drawings by Harriet Pincus, a noted illustrator of children's books, enhance the tale. Out of print for years, the book is now available in a new edition that introduces the story and its gloriously antic art to a new generation of parade-lovers, wedding-goers, and everyone who enjoys a fanciful celebration.</p></p><p>Carl Sandburg (1878&#x2013;1967) received&nbsp;three Pulitzer Prizes, one for his 1940 biography of Abraham Lincoln and two for his poetry. His classic works include <i>The Rootabaga Stories,</i> written early in his career for his children, from which the text of this volume was taken.

Clearly written and copiously illustrated with line drawings, the book is accessible to those with little or no botanical training, yet it also is respected by botanists as an authoritative introduction to agrostology.<br><br>Last updated in 1959, the book now has been thoroughly revised to reflect current scientific knowledge, nomenclature, and classification. Divided into twelve lessons, the guide first surveys the basic vegetative and reproductive parts of a grass plant, then in succeeding lessons takes up increasingly more complex modifications. Formally recognized groups of grasses are discussed in a taxonomic context, with the principal focus on grass structures, particularly those of inflorescences and spikelets. Virtually all of the species discussed are illustrated with detailed line drawings. With the addition in this edition of a lesson on bamboos, coverage now extends to tropical regions and encompasses all major groups of grasses. The book also includes a short biography of Agnes Chase in the foreword and, for the first time in this edition, a glossary accompanies the appendices on grass classification.</p><p><b>Lynn G.

R. Dodds takes on the traditional view of Greek culture as a triumph of rationalism. Using the analytical tools of modern anthropology and psychology, Dodds asks, "Why should we attribute to the ancient Greeks an immunity from 'primitive' modes of thought which we do not find in any society open to our direct observation?" Praised by reviewers as "an event in modern Greek scholarship" and "a book which it would be difficult to over-praise," <i>The Greeks and the Irrational </i>was Volume 25 of the Sather Classical Lectures series.</p><p>&#34;An exciting and fundamental subject; profound learning illuminated by imaginative insight and controlled by a modest and balanced judgment; a literary style of exceptional clarity, vigour, and elegance; the combination of these ingrediants produces a book which it would be difficult to over-praise.&#34;--&#34;Oxford Magazine&#34;</p><h2>Postcolonial Thought and Social Theory</h2><p>Social scientists have long resisted the radical ideas known as postcolonial thought, while postcolonial scholars have critiqued the social sciences for their Euro-centric focus. However, in <em>Postcolonial Thought and Social Theory</em>, Julian Go attempts to reconcile the two seemingly contradictory fields by crafting a postcolonial social science. Contrary to claims that social science is incompatible with postcolonial thought, this book argues that the two are mutually beneficial, drawing upon the works of thinkers such as Franz Fanon, Amilcar Cabral, Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Gayatri Spivak. Go concludes with a call for a "third wave" of postcolonial thought emerging from social science and surmounting the narrow confines of disciplinary boundaries.<br></p><p><br><strong>Julian Go</strong> is Professor of Sociology at Boston University. His previous books on the US empire have won prizes from the American Sociological Association, the International Studies Association, and the American Political Science Association.<br><br>"Go's main thesis is that the social sciences could and should be transformed by an encounter with postcolonial theory... wondering whether postmodernism was worth all the fuss, Go's book leaves us in no doubt as to the value of postcolonial thought for social theory... sociologists would do well to consider Go's important and provocative book." -- <em>Joel Isaac, European Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br>"A revolution is coming in social theory, and here is one of its prophets. Julian Go's scholarly and vigorous argument shows why the global-North hegemony in social science can't survive. Even better, he shows how the bases of social science can change, with an epistemology that is realist without being dogmatic, multiple without being fragmented. Everyone concerned with the future of social thought will learn from this book." <br>-Raewyn Connell, author of <em>Southern Theory and Gender in World Perspective'<p></p></em><br>"If ideas are shaped by social environments then the imperial culture in which American sociology was born and flourished has left its imprint on the discipline. In this wonderful, erudite, accessible, and deeply sociological look at sociology, Julian Go shows us the analytic misrecognitions wrought by its refusal to incorporate the structuring forces of colonialism into the core of its theoretical repertoire. But he does not stop at critique. Rather, he sifts through various strands of postcolonial theory, feminism, and early sociological theorizing of race and empire, to create the possibility of a new, relevant, relational, and genuinely global, sociology."-Raka Ray, Professor of Sociology and South and Southeast Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley <br><p></p><br>"My brief summary cannot adequately capture the clarity of Go's writing, quality of his synthesis, and significance of his theoretical manifesto. Nevertheless, I hope that the wider relevance of Go's book is obvious to readers of Pacific Affairs. In my view, <em>Postcolonial Thought and Social Theory</em> is a key text for scholars seeking to critique the mainstream paradigms of their particular fields and create alternative approaches." <br>--<em>Pacific Affairs</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Ethics: Essential Readings in Moral Theory</h2><p><p><em>Ethics: Essential Readings in Moral Theory </em>is an outstanding anthology of the most important topics, theories and debates in ethics, compiled by one of the leading experts in the field.

Ranging from the antebellum period to the coming of the Great Depression, the book examines the extensive literature slave masters produced on how to manage and "develop" slaves; explores what was perhaps the greatest managerial feat in U.S. history, the building of the transcontinental railroad, which pitted Chinese and Irish work gangs against each other; and concludes by looking at how these strategies survive today in the management of hard, low-paying, dangerous jobs in agriculture, military support, and meatpacking. Roediger and Esch convey what slaves, immigrants, and all working people were up against as the objects of managerial control. Managers explicitly ranked racial groups, both in terms of which labor they were best suited for and their relative value compared to others. The authors show how whites relied on such alleged racial knowledge to manage and believed that the "lesser races" could only benefit from their tutelage. These views wove together managerial strategies and white supremacy not only ideologically but practically, every day at workplaces. Even in factories governed by scientific management, the impulse to play races against each other, and to slot workers into jobs categorized by race, constituted powerful management tools used to enforce discipline, lower wages, keep workers on dangerous jobs, and undermine solidarity.<br><br>Painstakingly researched and brilliantly argued, <em>The Production of Difference</em> will revolutionize the history of labor race in the United States.<br></p><p><br><strong>David R.

With historical depth and concise analyses, they demonstrate how racialized divisions of labor were as much the modern means for maximizing profit as they were the means to foster competition among different racial, national, and ethnic groups. In doing so, they provide the most compelling case for the necessity of cross-racial workers' solidarity."--Lisa Lowe, University of California, San Diego<p></p><br>"Fascinating....highly readable....The book's wide scope gives it a bold and provocative edge, and should make it of interest to scholars in several fields."--<em>Indiana Magazine of History</em><p></p><br>"A remarkable and provocative book that breaks new ground in the study of racial and class formation in American history....A powerful and timely contribution, <em>The Production of Difference</em> should provoke new debates on the role of management in the construction of race from the nineteenth century to today."--Chris Rhomberg, <em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"This wide-ranging account of management-by-race-from southern slave plantations and the construction of the transcontinental railroads to Frederick Winslow Taylor's factories and the Philippines' Benguet Road-convincingly documents that discrimination (albeit sometimes mixed with race development theory) has long formed a central strand of American business practice."--Leon Fink, University of Illinois at Chicago<p></p><br>"<em>The Production of Difference</em> is a masterful work that should revolutionize the research and teaching of U.S. management history. Breaking much new ground, Roediger and Esch's book vividly demonstrates that the management of U.S. labor originated not with Frederick Taylor and scientific management but instead with U.S. slavery's plantation system. Destined to become a classic, it is essential reading for every serious scholar, and should be assigned for all courses, in U.S. management history."--Victor G. Devinatz, Illinois State University<p></p><br>"In these well-documented case studies David Roediger and Elizabeth Esch convincingly show how the rise of the United States from a semi-peripheral economy in the early nineteenth century to capitalism's hegemonic power in the twentieth century was attended by an increasingly sophisticated strategy of 'race management'-building on methods first tried out on slave plantations, and playing different segments of the working class off against each other. The book opens up a whole new field of research."--Marcel van der Linden, International Institute of Social History<p></p><br>"This book is a marvel of historical research. It puts new light on how slavery and westward expansion helped to embed racial thinking in 'labor management' and how racial thinking continued as a means to divide and rule and to maximize profits. <em>The Production of Difference</em> requires us to rethink root causes of the persistent perpetuation of racism in American life."--Michael Honey, author of <em>Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis Strike, Martin Luther King's Last Campaign</em><p></p><br>"A 'must read,' <em>The Production of Difference</em> is of great importance to a readership that goes beyond the academic.

Their examination of the symbiotic relationship between racial theorists and employers is subtle and persuasive."--Robert H. Zieger, <em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"The implication of the authors' diligent research and exacting analysis is that what has been termed 'American exceptionalism' may actually be just a byproduct of 'race management,' which, inter alia, has wrung superprofits out of compulsory labor and manipulating racial and ethnic tensions within the US labor force...This book should be viewed as a landmark in numerous fields-labor history, the history of US management, and racial and ethnic studies."--Gerald Horne, <em>Enterprise &amp; Society</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Introduction to Islam: Beliefs and Practices in Historical Perspective</h2><p><p><strong>A comprehensive history of Islam and the diverse beliefs and practices of Muslims, written by one of the most eminent historians of Islam working today</strong></p> Carole Hillenbrand, long acknowledged as a preeminent authority on Islam, has now written a superb introduction to this great world religion, a book that promises to be the most lucid, nuanced text of its kind on the market.

For landscape architects and architects it is an indispensable guide to correct and professional execution planning as well as to preparing solid and well-thought-out requests for proposal.<em> </em></p> <p><em>Constructing Landscape</em> is divided into two sections, Materials and Surfaces and Building Construction and Building Elements. The first section provides an overview of the various building materials of landscape architecture and their specific characteristics. It also explains the qualities of surfaces and the different approaches to treating them. The second section begins with an introductory chapter explaining the principles of statics, the connections of load-bearing elements, and the various approaches to anchoring building compo-nents and supporting structures. The subsequent chapters use drawings and text to present the constructional principles and techniques associated with the various building elements. Each chapter concludes with a collection of sample projects, illustrated with photographs and technical drawings.</p></p><p>Constructing Landscape is a systematically structured reference work about the techniques and theories applied when constructing outdoor spaces. All the relevant topics are vividly covered, from materials and surfaces via building outdoor features to the use of plants. The book shows how landscape designers and architects can implement their creative ideas with expertise and technical skill. Constructing Landscape is in three parts: "Materials", "The principles of loadbearing structures" and "Structural elements and building methods". The first part surveys various building materials used in landscape architecture, and their specific qualities. Surface properties and possible working modes are also discussed. The next section explains the fundamental principles of statics, joints for loadbearing elements, foundations for structural components, and supporting structures. The third chapter is devoted to the principles of construction and techniques associated with various structural elements. A large collection of realized sample projects illustrates particular building tasks with photographs and plans.

Over 250 activities introduce topics for personal reflection, and discussion points encourage students to think for themselves and build their own arguments. Highlighting the potential pitfalls for those new to bioethics, each chapter features boxes providing factual information and outlining the philosophical background, along with detailed case studies that offer an insight into real-life examples of bioethical problems. Within-chapter essay questions and quizzes, along with end-of-chapter review questions, allow students to check their understanding and to broaden their thinking about the topics discussed. The accompanying podcasts by the author (two of whose podcasts on iTunesU(TM) have attracted over 3 million downloads) explain points that might be difficult for beginners. These, along with a range of extra resources for students and instructors, are available at www.cambridge.org/bioethics.</p><p>This accessible introduction clearly explains bioethical issues and their philosophical foundations to science students, providing them with the confidence needed to debate important issues in the ethics of biotechnology.

This volume provides a clear, readable, and reliable translation of <i>Auch eine Philosophie der Geschichte zur Bildung der Menschheit</i>, supplemented by some of Herder's other important writings on politics and history. The editors' insightful Introduction traces the role of Herder's thought in the evolution of nationalism and highlights its influence on fields such as history, anthropology, and politics. The volume is designed to give English-speaking readers more ready access to the thinker whom Isaiah Berlin called the father of the related notions of nationalism, historicism, and Volksgeist.</p></p><p><p>Ioannis D. Evrigenis is Assistant Professor of Political Science, Tufts University.</p><p>Daniel Pellerin is Assistant Professor of Political Science at the National University of Singapore.</p><p>Evrigenis and Pellerin should be congratulated for editing this volume, which publishes Herder's smaller and early work, <i>Another Philosophy of History</i>, including six smaller essays on the same topic. This volume offers the opportunity to introduce Herder to students in a survey of the history of political thought, along with his better-known contemporaries such as Rousseau, Kant, Burke, and Hegel, as well as their predecessors Machiavelli, Locke, and Hobbes. Evrigenis and Pellerin's edition gives the reader a fine introduction to Herder and his thought. The selections of the smaller essays are very helpful in allowing someone unfamiliar with Herder to see how his important thoughts could be responsible in shaping how thinkers in the later half of the 19th Century thought about the nation and the role of politics in general.

Together, these insights suggest that in order to motivate students for academic learning, produce deep understanding, and ensure the transfer of educational experiences into real-world skills and careers, educators must find ways to leverage the emotional aspects of learning.<br><br> Immordino-Yang has both the gift for captivating readers with her research and the ability to connect this research to everyday learning and teaching.

And now, there's new material about how to do FBAs outside of clinical settings--at school, in the community, and at home--making this strategy more accessible to parents and teachers in daily life.</p></p><p>Beth Glasberg, Ph.D., BCBA-D, is the Director of Glasberg Behavioral Consulting Services, LLC, and an adjunct professor at Rider University. <p> Robert H.

Design is deliberate-a process of exploring multiple solutions and choosing the most promising option. Through an immersion in 2-D, 3-D, and 4-D concepts, students are encouraged to develop methods of thinking visually that will serve them throughout their studies and careers.<br>Building on strengths of the previous five editions, the sixth edition of Launching the Imagination is even more:�Concise: Content has been refined so that maximum content can be communicated as clearly and concisely as possible.�Colorful: In addition to the full color used throughout the book, the writing is livelier than that in most textbooks. Analogies expand communication, and every visual example has been carefully selected for maximum impact.�Comprehensive: Launching the Imagination is the only foundational text with full sections devoted to critical and creative thinking and to time-based design. The photo program is global, represents a myriad of stylistic approaches, and prominently features design and media arts as well as more traditional art forms.�Contemporary: More than half of the visual examples represent artworks completed since 1970, and over 100 represent works completed since 2000.�Compelling: Interviews with exemplars of creativity have always been an important feature of this book. Three of the best past profiles have been revised and a new profile has been added. Now inserted into the body of the text, each interview deliberately builds on its chapter content.</p><p>Mary Stewart&#x2015;author, artist, and educator&#x2015;is the Foundations Program Director for the Art Department at Florida State University and co-founder of Integrative Teaching Thinktank, a national organization devoted to strengthening college-level teaching.

In this revelatory book, family therapist Monica McGoldrick explains how the use of genograms (family trees) can bring to light a family's history of estrangement, alliance, divorce, or suicide, revealing intergenerational patterns that prove more than coincidental.<br><br> McGoldrick's genograms of famous families, such as the Kennedys, Hepburns, Beethovens, and Bront�s, complement discussion of the influence of birth order and sibling rivalry, family myths and secrets, cultural differences, couple relationships, and the pivotal role of loss. At the close of each chapter are questions that train the reader to think as researcher; with McGoldrick's guidance, we learn to mine previously untapped information about our own family patterns. Photographs, drawings</p><p>No matter how old we are, or how far from home, our family remains with us - we share their looks and gestures, social values and concept of &#34;home&#34;. Yet we often fail to connect with family members, and in remarkable ways our early experiences with family are repeated with marriage partners and children. In this revelatory book, esteemed family therapist Monica McGoldrick explores why families behave as they do, using genograms (family trees) to illustrate family patterns. Mapped out over a three-generation span, repeated estrangements, alliances, even divorces and suicides prove more than coincidental. McGoldrick uses the genograms of famous families - including the Kennedys, Hepburns, Beethovens, Brontes, and the family of the Marx Brothers - to discuss the influence of birth order and sibling rivalry, family myths and secrets, cultural differences, couple relationships, and the pivotal role of loss. Relevant questions we can ask ourselves appear at the end of each chapter, helping the reader to become researcher, uncovering information previously withheld, misunderstood, or overlooked. There is a saying, &#34;Those who cannot remember the past are recommended to repeat it&#34;. The message here is positive: once we reconnect with the past, McGoldrick tells us, we can choose our futures.Monica McGoldrick, M.A., M.S.W., Ph.D., is co-founder and director of the Multicultural Family Institute in Highland Park, New Jersey, and adjunct faculty at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.

Still exuberantly fresh despite their age, they primarily follow two characters (and their descendants): Cobb Anderson, who instigated the first robot revolution and is offered immortality by his grateful "children," and stoner Sta-Hi Mooney, who (against his impaired better judgment) becomes an important figure in robot-human relations. Over several generations, humans, robots, and society evolve, but even weird drugs and the wisdom gathered from interstellar signals won't stop them from making the same old mistakes in new ways.

As Imperial Japanese Navy flying boats and land-based bombers penetrated over vast distances, a few under-strength squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force put up a spirited fight. However it was the supreme power of aircraft carriers that had the biggest impact. Four Japanese fleet carriers facilitated the capture of Rabaul over a devastating four-day period in January 1942. The following month, the USS Lexington&#x2019;s fighter squadron VF-3 scored one of the most one-sided victories of the entire Pacific War. By March 1942 the Japanese had landed on mainland New Guinea, and the scene was set for a race to control Port Moresby. <br><br>This is the full story of both sides of an air war that could have been won by either incumbent, but for timing, crucial decisions and luck.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Contents<br>List of Aircraft Profiles<br>Dedication<br>Introduction<br>Chapter 1 Japanese Plans for the South Pacific<br>Chapter 2 Allied Defences in the South Pacific<br>Chapter 3 RAAF Pokes the Giant - December 1941<br>Chapter 4 Fourth Fleet Turns South &#x2013; January 1942<br>Chapter 5 Colonel Scanlan&#x2019;s Dilemma<br>Chapter 6 Carrier Attack Day 1 &#x2013; 20th January 1942<br>Chapter 7 Carrier Attack Day 2 &#x2013; 21st January 1942<br>Chapter 8 Carrier Attack Day 3 &#x2013; 22nd January 1942<br>Chapter 9 Rabaul on the Eve of Invasion<br>Chapter 10 Invasion &#x2013; 23rd January 1942<br>Chapter 11 Consolidation of Rabaul &#x2013; late January to early February 1942<br>Chapter 12 Gasmata &#x2013; Early February 1942<br>Chapter 13 South Pacific Buildup &#x2013; mid-February 1942<br>Chapter 14 Black Day for No. 4 Ku &#x2013; 20th February 1942<br>Chapter 15 USAAC Enters the Fray &#x2013; Late February to early March 1942<br>Chapter 16 Lae and Salammaua &#x2013; to 9th March 1942<br>Chapter 17 Bougainville and The Solomons &#x2013; to March 1942<br>Chapter 18 Lark Force Postscript<br>Appendix 1 Confirmed Aircraft Losses &#x2013; 8 December 1941 to 9 March 1942<br>Appendix 2 Surviving Aircraft<br>Sources<br>Index<br></p><p>Raised in Port Moresby, Michael Claringbould is a globally recognized expert on the New Guinea air war and Japanese aviation in particular.<br><br>Peter Ingman is an acclaimed military history author specializing in the early Pacific War period."South Pacific Air War definitely weaves together many different threads, especially highlighting the Japanese perspective wherever possible.

Today, the War on Terror has drawn it to Afghanistan and Iraq. To Lieutenant Colonel Mike Infanti's unit fell the pacification of a hellish hotbed of terrorism south of Baghdad dubbed "The Triangle of Death." Of the more than three thousand Americans killed since the start of the war, more than one thousand were in this region. </p><p>Colonel Infanti assigned Delta Company to the most dangerous sector of the Triangle. Delta knew they were virtually assured of getting hit on a daily basis. Each day and night became something to be dreaded and feared.</p><p>In the predawn of May 12, 2007, two humvees occupied by seven soldiers and an Iraqi translator were ambushed by insurgents. When the smoke cleared, four soldiers and the translator were dead and three were missing, presumably seized by the enemy. For more than a year, Delta searched for their missing comrades, never giving up hope. Their creed of battle: None Left Behind.</p></p><p><p>Charles W.

The disappearance of children was always a warning.</p><p>An IED went off underneath Knowlden&#x2019;s lead vehicle and sandblasted out the windows. Infanti heard the whooshing report of an 85mm rocket-propelled grenade belching from the mouth of an alley to his right. It caught the commander&#x2019;s truck near the right front door, the concussion tossing it sideways in the street and popping open the doors.</p><p>Although disorientated and almost unconscious from injuries to the back of his head, Infanti leaped out of the smoking truck with his M-4 blazing against black-hooded RPG gunners hammering the stalled convoy from the alley and from the cover of a nearby wall. Rockets crisscrossed the street, screaming and etching smoke. One struck the pavement and skidded underneath a hummer where it detonated in a ball of red flame, jolting the truck completely off the ground. Another targeted the last unscathed vehicle in the convoy and ripped off a tire. A third penetrated the rear hatch of Captain Knowlden&#x2019;s disabled truck and lodged in its cargo of blankets without exploding.</p><p>In the midst of all the smoke, noise, and confusion, Knowlden saw Colonel Infanti collapse in the street next to his truck, seemingly unconscious or mortally wounded. His adrenaline had finally worn off. Knowlden got on the radio, yelling for the medic who always accompanied a commander&#x2019;s patrol. The call was unnecessary. Courville was already racing through the smoke toward Infanti.</p><p>Excerpted from None Left Behind by Charles W. Sasser.<br>Copyright 2009 by Charles W.

Now she serves up the most tantalizing novel of her career as an enterprising woman allies herself with a mysterious spy, only to be caught up in a torrid brew of treachery&#x2013;and temptation....<br><br><b>SLIGHTLY SHADY<br></b><br>From the moment the stranger burst into her antiquities shop in Rome, Lavinia Lake knew he was nothing but trouble. He said he was in pursuit of a killer. He swore he was only trying to save her. Yet Lavinia was convinced that Mr. Tobias March was bent instead on destroying her. When the self-described spy hustled her all the way back to England, Lavinia vowed she would find a way to repay him in full. She never dreamed that Mr. March had in fact been telling the truth, that he had been hired to track down a powerful villain. And just as his investigation was heating up, he found it complicated by the most ungovernable, exasperating&#x2013;and slightly shady&#x2013;woman he had ever met. Lavinia most certainly never dreamed they would meet again, forced into partnership under shocking circumstances&#x2013;or that their fiery disputes would spark a sizzling desire as overwhelming as the danger they faced....</p><p>There's something <i>Slightly Shady</i> about Lavinia Lake. First of all, no decent woman would go into trade, even when an unscrupulous employer leaves her stranded abroad with her young niece. But the capable Lavinia has landed on her feet, peddling dubious reproductions of ancient artifacts in Rome to earn passage home. When a madman ransacks her shop, accusing her of aiding and abetting a murderous gang of thieves, Lavinia and her niece Emeline return to London, where Lavinia once more takes lemons and makes lemonade, becoming a private investigator. In the course of her first discreet inquiry for a wealthy aristocrat with secrets to hide, Lavinia runs into her madman once more, standing over the recently deceased body of a blackmailer. Not exactly your usual beginning for a relationship, but Mr. Tobias March is hardly an ordinary man. In fact, he's quite extraordinary, Lavinia very reluctantly admits to herself. When threats to Lavinia's safety force her into an unlikely partnership with the mysterious Mr. March, the fur--and a petticoat or two--flies. A heady combination of passion and the shared thrill of the hunt for a depraved murderer may lead Lavinia and Tobias to form a partnership of a more permanent kind. Lively suspense with a healthy dose of passion, Amanda Quick's <i>Slightly Shady</i> is truly addictive storytelling. <i>--Alison Trinkle</i>&#x201c;Quick has spun a tense and romantic tale in thecrumpets-and-strumpets milieu of Regency England, and her pacing is impeccable....Bottom line: sexy and suspenseful.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;People<br><br></i>&#x201c;If you start an Amanda Quick book in the late afternoon, you&#x2019;ll probably spend the night with it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The Denver Post<br></i></p><h2>Margaret Truman&#39;s Undiplomatic Murder: A Capital Crimes Novel (Capital Crimes, 27)</h2><p><p>Private investigator Robert Brixton has always hated Washington. Against his better judgment, he decides to stick around and take a job as an agent in a new State Department security agency headed by his former boss at the Washington P.D. After work one day he meets his youngest daughter, Janet, for a drink at an outdoor cafe. Shockingly, a young Arabic woman blows herself up, killing Janet and a dozen others.

Donald Bain thrills again with <i>Margaret Truman's Undiplomatic Murder</i>, the riveting next installment in the Margaret Truman's beloved Capital Crimes series.</p></p><p><p>MARGARET TRUMAN won faithful readers with her works of biography and fiction, particularly her Capital Crimes mysteries. Her novels let readers into the corridors of power and privilege, and poverty and pageantry, in the nation's capital. </p><p>DONALD BAIN, the author of 115 books, including forty of the bestselling <i>Murder, She Wrote</i> novels, was a longtime friend of Margaret Truman. He worked closely with her on her novels, and more than anyone understood the spirit and substance of her books.</p><p>CHAPTER</p> <p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>WASHINGTON, D.C.</p> <p>She was late, no surprise. Brixton&#x2019;s younger daughter, Janet, was habitually late, pathologically late. Brixton, on the other hand, was a stickler for being on time, which only exacerbated his annoyance.</p> <p>He and Janet had been at odds for much of her teen and adult years about a variety of things, which Brixton sometimes found to be interesting in retrospect. Janet&#x2019;s sister, Jill, and she were polar opposites in personality and perception of life, which was usually the case with siblings. Jill had been the proverbial straight arrow for most of her life, her teenage years uneventful, and she&#x2019;d breezed through college and emerged with a degree in accounting. Her ease with numbers amazed her father. Balancing a checkbook for him was akin to dental visits and watching TV reality shows. She had married a solid sort of guy&#x2014;at least that&#x2019;s how Brixton perceived him; he shaved every day, enjoyed fruity alcoholic drinks with little umbrellas in them, and watched the History Channel&#x2014;and they produced Brixton&#x2019;s first and only grandchild, at least for the moment, an adorable little baby boy whose smile melted Brixton the few times he&#x2019;d been charmed by him in person.</p> <p>Janet, on the other hand, defined for her father the term &#x201c;flaky.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d used drugs during her teen years, run with a controversial crowd, dropped out of college after one semester, and decorated herself with a pair of garish tattoos. She not only had pierced her ears, she wore a tiny gold nugget in her upper lip. Brixton couldn&#x2019;t even look at the lip when they were together, which hadn&#x2019;t been often of late. He hated the tattoos and the pierced lip. They detracted from her natural beauty, and the thought of having someone stick a needle through her lip caused him to cringe.</p> <p>He wasn&#x2019;t sure how his daughter made a living; he just knew that whatever it was didn&#x2019;t always provide enough for her to pay her bills. He did know that she was involved in the city&#x2019;s club and music scene in some capacity, managing some rock-and-roll musicians, promoting concerts, working in recording studios&#x2014;never anything steady. Her calls to him usually involved a need for money to repair her car or to keep the lights on and the telephone in operation, calls that he sometimes responded to despite resenting it. &#x201c;Grow up,&#x201d; he told her on more than one occasion. &#x201c;Get a real job and take the responsibility of supporting yourself.&#x201d; She always agreed with him, a smart technique when dealing with an irate father, but never resulting in a change in lifestyle. Meeting today in the outdoor caf� a few blocks from the State Department in Foggy Bottom resulted from one of those telephone conversations.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>&#x201c;Hi, Daddy. It&#x2019;s Janet.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, sweetheart. How are you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2014;am&#x2014;wonderful!&#x201d;</p> <p>He smiled at her happy tone. At the same time her calling him &#x201c;Daddy&#x201d; set up his defenses. She seldom referred to him that way unless she needed something.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been going with this dynamite musician, Daddy, soooo talented, a real musical genius.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah? What&#x2019;s he play?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Guitar.&#x201d;</p> <p>Brixton pictured this &#x201c;genius&#x201d; stalking the stage, leaping up and down, hair flying, amplifiers blaring, the air filled with colored lights and marijuana smoke. As far as Brixton was concerned, rock music shouldn&#x2019;t be called music. An inveterate jazz lover, he remembered what the great saxophonist James Moody had once said to an interviewer when asked what he thought of rock and roll: &#x201c;You really can&#x2019;t play an instrument when you&#x2019;re jumping up and down,&#x201d; the gentle jazz giant responded. That summed it up for Brixton.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s great, Janet,&#x201d; he said. What else was there to say?</p> <p>&#x201c;Daddy, Richard&#x2014;that&#x2019;s his name&#x2014;Richard has come up with an idea for a music app that will make him millions, and he wants me, <i>me,</i> to work on it with him&#x2014;but he needs start-up money and asked me to help raise some and&#x2026;&#x201d; She paused for breath. &#x201c;And so I thought that maybe you would want to get in on the ground floor and&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; Brixton said. &#x201c;Slow down. You&#x2019;re talking to the wrong guy, sweetheart. I don&#x2019;t have money to invest in anything. I&#x2019;m a working stiff. Remember?&#x201d;</p> <p>Her bubbly presentation instantly turned downbeat, as he&#x2019;d expected it would.</p> <p>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t you even hear me out?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m listening.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, I mean <i>really</i> listen to me. I can&#x2019;t do it justice over the phone. It&#x2019;s too&#x2014;well, it&#x2019;s too complicated, and I have some stuff that he&#x2019;s come up with, a business plan and things like that. Can&#x2019;t we get together so I can show you everything and&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;When?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Tonight?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay. I have a meeting at State; should be free by five thirty. There&#x2019;s a bar and restaurant with an outdoor caf� a block from State, on Twenty-third. Buy you a drink, an early dinner?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;d be great. I know the place. See you there.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>What struck Brixton as ironic about their strained relationship was that in many ways she more closely mirrored him than did his more conventional daughter. Despite his dedication to order and routine in his life, he could be as impetuous as she was. His suspicion of authority butted heads with his having been a cop, first in Washington, D.C., and later with the Savannah Police Department in Georgia, where he rose to the rank of detective before taking a bullet in the knee and holding down a desk job for the months leading up to retirement. Like him, she marched to her own drummer and always had.</p> <p>But what most closely linked them was their unwillingness to walk the straight and narrow and choose the safe route through life. Both their lives flirted with danger, his because of what he did for a living, hers because of a need to chase dreams and to spend her days with others for whom life was but a dream, chemically induced or not.</p> <p>He finished off his mug of Prohibition Porter, a locally produced Belgian-style dark ale, checked his watch, grunted, and considered ordering a martini. He&#x2019;d opted for beer rather than his usual drink to ensure that he had all his senses while conversing about Janet&#x2019;s &#x201c;business proposition.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t feel deprived, because he&#x2019;d had martinis at this place and rated them second-class.</p> <p>Her arrival distracted him from having to decide. She looked terrific as she approached the caf�, tight jeans on her long legs, a snug, bright orange T-shirt that showed off her firm, ample bosom, and orange sneakers that matched the shirt. Her dirty blond hair was worn loose and caught the sun. She spotted him at a table next to the door leading inside the restaurant, smiled broadly, slipped past other tables, leaned over, and kissed his forehead before taking her seat.</p> <p>&#x201c;You look great,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;So do you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;For an old guy?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re not old. How old are you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fifty-one.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;See? That&#x2019;s young.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Drink?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A cosmo.&#x201d;</p> <p>Because of its close proximity to the State Department, the caf� was a favorite hangout for diplomatic personnel, at least lower-level employees. With the weather clear and balmy, it had filled up since Brixton had arrived and commandeered the table.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nice spot,&#x201d; Janet commented as a waiter took her order for a cosmopolitan and a second beer for Brixton.</p> <p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t drink martinis anymore?&#x201d; she asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, sure I do. A beer appealed. Nice day for a beer. Besides, places with outdoor caf�s usually make lousy martinis.&#x201d;</p> <p>She laughed. &#x201c;How can that be?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Why would an outdoor caf� serve martinis that aren&#x2019;t as good as inside places?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Because martinis taste better indoors. I remember when I was in Paris. I really liked sitting in caf�s and watching the parade go by, but they made lousy martinis.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because they&#x2019;re French, not because you were outdoors. You should have had wine.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had martinis in this place, too,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not very good. Want another sage piece of advice? Never have a mixed drink in a Chinese restaurant. They haven&#x2019;t a clue how to make a decent one.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If you say so.&#x201d;</p> <p>Anxious to change the subject, Brixton quickly surveyed the menu and suggested calamari and an order of boneless ribs to go with their drinks.</p> <p>They fell into an easy conversation about anything other than the reason she&#x2019;d wanted to see him.</p> <p>&#x201c;A fat day,&#x201d; he commented, referring to the sunny, brilliant blue sky with a few puffy clouds to break the monotony, and a cooling breeze that caused their green market umbrella to flap.</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you go to Paris with that woman from Savannah that you were seeing?&#x201d; she asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Flo? Yeah. I met her in Savannah, but she was from New York.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You still see her?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. We split up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Did it make you sad?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Actually, I was kind of relieved.&#x201d;</p> <p>Which was true immediately following the breakup. But he&#x2019;d begun to miss her within a week and still did. Discussing his love life with his younger daughter made him uncomfortable, and he changed the players but not the subject.</p> <p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your mother?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She happy with her new husband?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I guess so.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You like him?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;</p> <p>Brixton didn&#x2019;t like the guy who&#x2019;d married his ex-wife, an attorney who looked like he spent all his time in a tanning salon and probably had a dental hygienist on a retainer to keep his teeth white.</p> <p>&#x201c;So, tell me about your business proposition,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>Brixton half listened as Janet explained what the music app was all about. It sounded silly to him, although he didn&#x2019;t do anything to transmit that reaction to her. She talked fast, her conversation filled with &#x201c;like&#x201d; and &#x201c;you know&#x201d; and &#x201c;right?&#x201d; He couldn&#x2019;t help but smile at her enthusiasm, her conviction that what she was excited about would change the world and everyone in it. Her eyes opened wide, then narrowed, speaking a language of their own. She paused occasionally in her soliloquy to see whether he&#x2019;d understood, and took his nod to indicate that he had.</p> <p>His attention drifted away from her words, captured by a couple who&#x2019;d passed the caf� a few times. The woman appeared to be of Arabic origins. She wore a long, loose black dress and a scarf that covered her hair and neck. She looked young, a teenager, Brixton judged. Her companion wasn&#x2019;t of Middle Eastern origins. He was dressed casually&#x2014;jeans, a blue-and-white-checked shirt, and a New York Yankee&#x2019;s baseball cap with longish blond curls sticking out beneath it. What attracted Brixton&#x2019;s attention were the furtive glances they cast on the crowd in the caf�, and he wondered why they hesitated coming in. There were a few empty tables, one directly across the doorway leading inside the restaurant from where Brixton and his daughter sat. It was on their third pass that they stopped and made their way to that table. A waiter asked for their order; the young man said, &#x201c;Lemonade.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Two?&#x201d; the waiter asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;One,&#x201d; the young man said. &#x201c;Just one.&#x201d;</p> <p>Brixton tried to eavesdrop but wasn&#x2019;t able to hear because of the buzz of voices around him. He continued to glance at them. At one point the young man leaned across the table and spoke in low tones, his mouth almost touching the cloth that covered his friend&#x2019;s ear. She said nothing in return. She turned once in Brixton&#x2019;s direction, and he clearly saw her face&#x2014;what he read on its unblemished youth was fear. Her companion also glanced at Brixton, who noticed the seawater green color of his eyes&#x2014;eyes with no expression.</p> <p>The waiter returned with the lemonade and placed it on the table. The young man pulled coins from his pants pocket, deposited them on the table, picked up the glass, and downed half of its contents. Then, after uttering something else to the girl, he stood and walked from the caf�, leaving her alone with the partially consumed drink.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Janet said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been yakking away and the food is getting cold.&#x201d; She dipped a piece of calamari in the red sauce. &#x201c;This is good,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Yummy. Aren&#x2019;t you going to have some?&#x201d;</p> <p>Brixton took a piece.</p> <p>&#x201c;So, where was I? Oh, right. Richard&#x2019;s idea is sooo smart, Daddy. It&#x2019;s, like, it&#x2019;s right on with the music scene that&#x2019;s going on today, so <i>with it.</i> It&#x2019;s like, you know, like when Steve Jobs invented the Apple and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; Brixton. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re comparing this fellow Richard to Steve Jobs?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, maybe not like him exactly, but apps are big these days and&#x2026;&#x201d; She noticed that Brixton wasn&#x2019;t listening as closely as he had been. &#x201c;Did you hear what I said?&#x201d; she asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p> <p>She laughed. &#x201c;What world are you in?&#x201d; she asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get out of here&#x201d; was his reply.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p> <p>He slapped cash on the table and stood.</p> <p>&#x201c;Daddy! I haven&#x2019;t finished.&#x201d; She pulled sheets of paper that she&#x2019;d wedged into the top of her jeans and placed them on the table. &#x201c;Richard has it all figured out. See? Here are the numbers and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>He grabbed her arm and tried to pull her to her feet. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>She looked up at him questioningly. &#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re leaving,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Come on, we&#x2019;ll go somewhere else.&#x201d;</p> <p>She stood. Assuming that she was following, Brixton moved to the sidewalk. He looked back for Janet, who stood tasting another curl of calamari.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, come on,&#x201d; he called.</p> <p>As he again turned in the direction of the sidewalk, the young woman wearing the hijab suddenly stood and began screeching a chant in Arabic. Brixton spun around. Janet was looking at the woman as though she were a street performer entertaining passersby.</p> <p>&#x201c;Janet!&#x201d; he barked, and started back into the caf�, his hands outstretched toward her. He&#x2019;d gotten only a few feet when the explosion occurred, an ear-splitting blast whose force hit him in the chest, sending him sprawling on his back on the sidewalk, his head making sharp contact with the concrete. Parts of a splintered table came flying in his direction, and he threw his arms over his face to shield it from the wooden shards and other debris that rained down&#x2014;plates, glasses, skin, limbs, eyeglasses, knives and forks, carafes of wine and mugs of beer, clothing, pieces of chairs, calamari, boneless ribs, pizza slices, and a toy gorilla that had been held by a child at a table two removed from where they had sat.</p> <p>The lingering reverberation from the blast mingled with screams, final sounds from the maimed, expressions of horror from witnesses to the carnage. Brixton&#x2019;s ears rang. He frantically discarded what had landed on him, twisted his torso, and used his hands to push himself up to a sitting position. He sat on the rubble-strewn sidewalk, blood dripping from the side of his face and back of his neck. He shook his head violently to try to clear the grayness from his mind, to make the incessant ringing stop, to make sense of what had just happened, of the legs and shoes of people rushing to the scene, of painful moans and wails of disbelief.</p> <p>Brixton stumbled to his feet to see what moments earlier had been a bustling caf� filled with happy people. That a slaughter had taken place was vibrantly and visually displayed. Bodies were everywhere, some piled on top of others, blood covering everything and everyone.</p> <p>He touched the side of his face and pulled bloody fingers away from the wound. He looked back into the caf� in search of his daughter but saw only a tangle of limbs and clothing where they had been sitting. &#x201c;Oh, my God,&#x201d; he whispered, then yelled, &#x201c;Janet!&#x201d; As he took a step in that direction, a second blast occurred, sending a ball of flame from somewhere inside the...</p></p><h2>Grounded</h2><p>From the award-winning playwright of <i>Elephant's Graveyard</i>, George Brant, comes the story of an ace fighter pilot who's career in the sky is ended early due to an unexpected pregnancy.

Recognizing when you are at risk for self-inflicted losses (Parts One and Two)2. Understanding the self-undermining influences in your life and learning how to transcend them (Part Three)3. Motivating yourself to choose the healthiest paths (Parts Four and Five)1WHO ARE YOU WHEN YOU'RE NOT BEING YOURSELF?<i>We are so used to disguising ourselves from others that we end up disguising ourselves from ourselves.</i>--FRAN�OIS DE LA ROUCHEFOUCAULD, DUC DE LA ROUCHEFOUCAULD&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We want to know and be known for our very best. One way we identify this is to look for the best in others. You probably have known rare individuals who seem to craft their lives moment-by-moment with deliberate, positive actions. People like Morrie Schwartz of <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i>, Mitch Albom's book about the seventy-eight-year-old former sociology professor who met his terminal illness with inspiring dignity and grace. How do people like Morrie live exceptional lives? What can we learn from such people about cultivating the exceptional in ourselves?Perhaps you feel at your best when you "follow your bliss," as Joseph Campbell wrote. Who or what within you recognizes your bliss and leads you to it? Pause for a moment and recall a time when you felt deeply content. Perhaps you experienced an epiphany about your life's goals, felt at peace with the world, or intuitively knew the right choice in difficult circumstances. Think of your most intimate relationship or closest friendship, and recall an exceptionally satisfying moment. Perhaps you felt deeply connected, seen, and heard. What was the source of these moments? What made them end? How might you create them more often?The answers on how to cultivate and express the exceptional within you are found to a large extent in how you define yourself. You have the ability to define who you are at any moment. For example, surveys have reported that:� 25 percent of high school students rated themselves in the top 1 percent in leadership ability� 80 percent of drivers rated themselves as better than average� 83 percent of college students thought themselves more generous than other people� 94 percent of university professors ranked themselves better than average at their jobs� 85 percent of people rate their own manners as good or excellent, but only 23 percent give the same marks to others� Individual investors at one conference confidently predicted, on average, that their own retirement savings would be twice the average size of the savings of all other investors in attendanceFlattering self-definitions like these are benign. Self-images exist on a continuum from helpful to harmful. You can view yourself as small or big, dumb or smart, unworthy or worthy, loser or winner. When you define yourself as small, dumb, unworthy, or a loser--even when you do so without awareness and are none of these--your attitudes, emotions, and actions move in accordance with this negative self-view. You can mentally negate years of love or work with a single thought. You can look at a twenty-year marriage and see only what is missing. You can look at a career of overcoming challenges and contributing to others and think, "So what?" Of course, the goodness in your marriage isn't actually lost and your career accomplishments don't actually vanish. But when you feel small, it is as though what you do counts for nothing.The vast array of ways we define ourselves without knowing we're doing so is astounding. A fleeting first impression, when acted upon, sets in motion one course of events and excludes a universe of possible others. A doubt, once you run with it, can dictate your actions and moods. You might take a moment and recall a time when you lost an opportunity, a cherished connection, financial wealth, or happiness because you were behaving in accord with a negative self-image. <i>Simply because of a definition</i>.You've probably seen this happen to loved ones. At times, they may have chosen to quit, even when you knew they could have kept going and succeeded. At other times, they may have chosen to believe in themselves, perhaps with your help, and kept going instead.The irony is that every time you undermine yourself with a negative or inaccurate self-image, you provide evidence of your extraordinarypower. You possess an innate ability to make a convincing case for your worth, or the lack of it. You can foster your dreams as well as neglect them. You can act from self-confidence or be overtaken by worry or guilt. Most important of all, you have the ability to forget who chose one self-image over another.How Self-deception WorksHow can you deceive yourself? It seems a contradiction in terms. One analogy for how self-deception works, offered by philosophy scholar Herbert Fingarette, is to that of falling asleep. Each night you go to bed and eventually sleep overtakes you. When you awaken, you may recall what your last thoughts were prior to falling asleep, or remember your first dream of the night, but it is impossible to remember the <i>exact moment</i> you fell asleep. In this shift from awake to asleep, even though you are the one doing it, sleep descends upon you.Self-deception is similar. Just as we are unaware of what is happening at the moment of falling asleep, we are unaware of the moment we enter into self-deception. Denial, like falling asleep, is experienced as happening <i>to</i> you. If you're aware of falling asleep, you're not yet asleep. When you see your denial at work, you're no longer fully in denial.During sleep, magical events happen. You dream. Your attention is selective. You may stir at the sound of your infant crying, but pay no attention to city sirens or country crickets. Similarly, with self-deception, you see what you want and ignore what's in plain sight. Self-deception lives in a world of alternate realities based on "what-if" or "if-only" premises. Social psychology researchers call this phenomenon <i>counterfactual thinking</i>. It is, quite literally, thinking and perceiving contrary to the facts.Counterfactualizing has benefits, or we wouldn't do it. It can give feelings of mastery, explain mysterious or upsetting events, and soothe or console by allowing you to shift blame or justify your own or others' actions. But your alternate realities may also drop roadblocks in your path.When I began researching this book and told others that I was investigating how and why people subtly mislead themselves and unwittingly sabotage their dreams and plans, the most common response I received was, "Oh, I know someone like that." Self-sabotaging behavioris often easier to see in others than in ourselves. When we view others' self-sabotage or lack of self-awareness, we often rubberneck as if passing a car wreck. It's distressing to see but fascinating to watch. We can't believe what they're doing. We're glad it's not us. We'd shudder to think of ourselves as similarly clueless, inept, or self-destructive. We wonder why they can't see it. We may try to warn them but it often seems as if they can't or won't listen.For example, perhaps you've noticed friends, family, neighbors, or coworkers who:� Repeatedly enter into inappropriate romantic relationships, each time vowing that this one will be different� Spend more time fantasizing about improbable financial windfalls, like winning the lottery, than working� Overbook and overpromise so often that you no longer trust what they say� Work hard to lose twenty pounds through various diets, then quickly regain the lost weight and then some� Dwell on regrets or resentments and can't seem to move on� Endlessly take care of others' needs ahead of their own but, in a candid moment, tell you how unappreciated they feel� Procrastinate by submitting a job application late after hours of hard work, only to find the job filled� Make major decisions without considering the consequences� Automatically shun advice or a helping hand� Ignore a romantic partner's mistreatment, or stay in an unhealthy relationship even after deciding to leave� Overspend wildly, but get a steady stream of new credit card applications� Yearn to have children, but choose potential mates who clearly signal they aren't interested in being a parentEverybody Keeps SecretsSelf-sabotaging denial is universal even among the famous and powerful. Two presidents faced impeachment after sabotaging themselves. Richard Nixon tried to cover up Watergate. Bill Clinton tried to cover up the Monica Lewinsky affair. Despite each man's strengths and accomplishments, their presidencies descended into embarrassment not only because they tried to keep secrets from the public, but because they kept secrets from themselves.Nixon audiotaped the Oval Office, then proceeded to repeatedly break the law and incriminate himself with the tapes running. What was he thinking? In wanting a record for posterity, he tied his own noose. Call it denial, a tragic flaw, or karma, Nixon engineered his march to the brink of impeachment and subsequent resignation.Clinton had an affair, but steadfastly denied it to a grand jury, friends, and the public. Then he admitted it. How could a man so intelligent use such poor judgment in his personal behavior, lie about it, then fail to take into account the damage that would ensue when his lie was exposed?Both Nixon and Clinton were in denial. Despite the immense power and responsibility of the office, the men who have been president and the women and men who will be president are just like you and me. They mislead, distract, and undermine themselves.What drives this phenomenon that has brought down presidents, kings, and the rich and powerful? Self-defeating denial has the power to hurt you and those you love in ways large and small. Most of us put a premium on not hurting others. Yet we hurt ourselves with a vast array of self-defeating behaviors.One reason it can be difficult always to act in your best interests is that behavior occurs along a continuum of awareness. At one end, you have little or no awareness of your actions or their negative consequences until afterward. At the opposite end, you know full well that what you're doing isn't in your best interests, but you do it anyway. In between, your awareness may be diffuse, for example an inkling or vague concern. It may be fleeting--a mental warning that passes quickly. You may know what to do but can't summon the motivation to act. Or you have competing motivations and can't choose.The following table illustrates this continuum.No matter where you find yourself on the continuum of awareness, denial plays a role. When you have no clue that you're getting in your way, your denial is total. You have little chance of avoiding unnecessary losses and no choice about the outcome. At best, you get lucky. Yet even when it seems as though you see the complete picture, something may be overlooked. Denial clouds your ability to see what you are doing, why you're doing it, and the negative consequences. As with the moment of falling asleep, something goes unwitnessed. It may be something you're distracting yourself from, pretending about, or bringing selective inattention to. Perhaps you lack a full recognition of the risks. Perhaps you silently abandon your values.Counterproductive efforts to sidestep loss:1. Tend to be reactive rather than chosen2. Are more likely to arise when you don't see all your optionsThe remedy for both is greater self-awareness.Self-deception Takes Many FormsOur secrets can be difficult to spot because they take so many forms. One of the most subtle ways of undermining ourselves is what social scientists sometimes term "self-handicapping."<i>Steven, now a distinguished and able engineer, nearly failed his licensing exam. He initially answered the multiple-choice test on scrap paper rather than on the exam sheet. He finished with a half hour to spare and began reviewing his answers, after which he intended to transfer the answers to the official scanner-ready sheet. The next thing he knew, the exam proctor announced, "Time is up, pencils down." Steven stared in shock at his empty answer sheet alongside his answers on scrap paper.</i><i>A sympathetic proctor allowed him to fill in the answer sheet under the proctor's scrutiny, and an appeal to the licensing board eventually allowed his score, which was significantly higher than average, to count.</i>&nbsp;<br>During the test, Steven felt that he was acting with good intentions. He wanted to be as certain of his answers as possible and hand in a pristine answer sheet without erasures or smudges. Afterward, his near-miss shook him. "I still don't know what I was thinking. If I were going to be all psychological about it, I suspect that my trial-run answer sheet might have to do with being nervous about making a final commitment to each answer," Steven says.Why would Steven fear commitments? One possibility is that he feared the blow to his self-esteem that a failure would trigger. Another possibility is that self-handicapping like Steven's can be an indirect way of protesting against authority when we feel we cannot directly or openly say no. In addition, self-handicapping covertly carries the potential to turn daunting situations into no-lose enterprises. If you put obstacles in your way and still triumph, your victory is all that much greater. Should you fail, you have ready-made explanations to excuse or mitigate your loss.There's nothing sinister or premeditated in self-handicapping. It happens when you haven't yet brought sufficient awareness to recognize and understand your counterproductive patterns.<i>Judy, a smart and competent attorney, nearly missed her shot at law school because she forgot to accept an offer of admission by the deadline. She was in her senior year of college and routinely met deadlines for her term papers and tests. She even submitted her law school financial aid package paperwork on time. But at 8 P.M. on May 15 she realized that she'd missed the law school's May 15 deadline for accepting admission offers. Only after a breakneck trip to a large city post of fice 100 miles away was Judy able to get her acceptance form postmarked before midnight to secure her admission to law school.</i>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes self-handicapping like Judy's is an attempt to resolve the dissonance between promising circumstances and a poor self-image.Judy grew up doubting her worth and abilities. In high school she wasn't part of the "in crowd" and didn't feel particularly attractive. Although Judy ranked twenty-third in a class of 350, in her way of thinking she was undeserving of being in the same league with the very top students.

After writing <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i>, Toole corresponded with Robert Gottlieb of Simon &amp; Schuster for two years. Exhausted from Gottlieb&#x2019;s suggested revisions, Toole declared the publication of the manuscript hopeless and stored it in a box. Years later he suffered a mental breakdown, took a two-month journey across the United States, and finally committed suicide on an inconspicuous road outside of Biloxi. Following the funeral, Toole&#x2019;s mother discovered the manuscript. After many rejections, she cornered Walker Percy, who found it a brilliant novel and spearheaded its publication.

The inhabitants and pilgrims of these lands had the use of tattooing their hands or forearms near their wrists. They were blue tattoos of figures, mottos, crosses, sacred symbols, pierced hearts, skulls and anchors. The origins of this tradition came from the Sanctuary of Loreto, probably it was an act of devotion or perhaps recognition.

For this edition, Crow (dean of the School of Art, Manchester Metropolitan Univ., UK) added more up-to-date illustrations and rewrote the captions. Those who own the first or second edition will not need this updated edition, but those who do not should acquire it because it is one of the few books to discuss various semiotics theories of design. (A comprehensive study of the Peircean semiotic theory of graphic design will be published by MIT in 2017, but until then Crow's is one of the more complete.) Crow does a fairly good job of explaining the differences between Peircean and Saussurian semiotic perspectives, but the really outstanding parts of this book are the excellent illustrations and the exercises. This book is aimed at undergraduate programs in graphic design, and it hits the mark.<br><b>Summing Up: </b>Recommended.

It followed by a year the great success of his score for <i>The Firebird,</i> also produced by the Ballets Russes, and it confirmed Stravinsky's reputation as the most gifted of the younger generation of Russian composers.<br>The ballet had begun in Stravinsky's mind as a "picture of a puppet suddenly endowed with life, exasperating the patience of the orchestra with diabolical cascades of arpeggios." Soon Diaghilev had convinced the young composer to turn the work into a ballet score. Benois was chosen to be his collaborator in the libretto, Fokine and Nijinsky became involved, and the bizarre tale of three dancing puppets &#x2014; Petrushka (a folk character in Russian lore), the Ballerina, and the Moor, brought to life in a tragic tale of love &#x2014; would soon become one of the most acclaimed and performed of ballet masterpieces.<br>Brilliantly orchestrated, filled with Russian folksong as well as new and striking harmonies, alternately poignant and splendidly imposing, the score of <i>Petrushka</i> continues to be a popular subject for the study of tonal language and orchestration. This edition is an unabridged republication of the original edition published in 1912 by Edition Russe de Musique in Berlin. Printed on fine paper, sturdily bound, yet remarkably inexpensive, it offers musical scholars, musical performers, and music lovers a lifetime of pleasurable study and enjoyment of one of the most popular and acclaimed musical works of the twentieth century.</p><p></p></p><p><p>The leading composer of his day, Igor Stravinsky experimented with virtually every technique of 20th century music.

Instead of fulfilling the order with high-quality arms, Efraim Diveroli, David Packouz, and Alex Podrizki (the dudes) bought cheap Communist-style surplus ammunition from Balkan gunrunners. The trio then secretly repackaged millions of rounds of shoddy Chinese ammunition and shipped it to Kabul&#x2014;until they were caught by Pentagon investigators and the scandal turned up on the front page of <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the &#x201c;official&#x201d; story.

It&#x2019;s a trip that goes from a dive apartment in Miami Beach to mountain caves in Albania, the corridors of power in Washington, and the frontlines of Iraq and Afghanistan. Lawson&#x2019;s account includes a shady Swiss gunrunner, Russian arms dealers, Albanian thugs, and a Pentagon investigation that caused ammunition shortages for the Afghanistan military. Lawson exposes the mysterious and murky world of global arms dealing, showing how the American military came to use private contractors like Diveroli, Packouz, and Podrizki as middlemen to secure weapons from illegal arms dealers&#x2014;the same men who sell guns to dictators, warlords, and drug traffickers.<br> <br>This is a story you were never meant to read.</p><p>Guy Lawson is a <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and award-winning investigative journalist whose articles on war, crime, culture, and law have appeared in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Magazine, Rolling Stone, GQ, Harper</i><i>&#x2019;</i><i>s</i> <i>Magazine</i>, and many other publications.War Dogs Chapter One<p></p> HELL-BENT<p></p> <br>The e-mail confirmed it: the delivery was back on track, after weeks of maddening, inexplicable delays. It was May 24, 2007, and the e-mail said that a cargo plane had just lifted off from a military airstrip in Hungary and was banking east over the Black Sea toward Kyrgyzstan, some three thousand miles away. After stopping to refuel at an air base in Bishkek, the plane would carry on to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. Aboard the plane were eighty pallets loaded with 5 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, for the Soviet Bloc weapons preferred by the Afghan National Army.<br> <br>Reading the e-mail in his tiny office in Miami Beach, David Packouz breathed a sigh of relief. The shipment was part of the $300 million ammunition contract Packouz and his friends Efraim Diveroli and Alex Podrizki were attempting to fulfill for the Department of Defense. Packouz and his buddies were still in their early twenties, but they&#x2019;d been contracted by the US Army to deliver a huge amount of munitions to the Afghanistan military. Bidding online, on the website where the Pentagon posted defense contracts for public competition, the stoner dudes had beat major corporations to win the Afghan contract. For weeks in the spring of 2007, Packouz had toiled tirelessly trying to obtain flyover permissions for the ammo from the countries between Hungary and Afghanistan&#x2014;all formerly part of the Soviet Bloc. Working with nothing more than a cell phone, an Internet connection, and a steady supply of high-quality weed, he&#x2019;d finally succeeded in getting the ammo en route to Kabul. But along the way Packouz had repeatedly encountered mysterious, invisible forces seemingly conspiring to stop him from delivering the ammo&#x2014;the kind of political complications inherent in gunrunning.<br> <br>Five thousand miles away, in the Balkan city of Tirana, Albania, Packouz&#x2019;s friends Efraim Diveroli and Alex Podrizki were also dealing with menacing and mysterious forces as they tried to arrange for 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo to be transported to Kabul. Alone in a notoriously lawless country, Diveroli and Podrizki were trying to negotiate with an Albanian mafioso taking kickbacks, as well as a Swiss gun dealer running the deal through a Cyprus company seemingly as a way to grease the palms of shadowy operators allegedly associated with the prime minister of Albania. Or so it appeared&#x2014;knowing the underlying truth was often impossible in international arms dealing. As if those woes weren&#x2019;t enough, Diveroli and Podrizki were also overseeing an operation to deceive the Pentagon by covertly repacking the AK-47 rounds into cardboard boxes to disguise that they had been manufactured decades earlier in China&#x2014;a possible violation of American law.<br> <br>Gunrunning, the three dudes were learning the hard way, was a tough business.<br> <br>In Miami, David Packouz replied to the e-mail about the Kyrgyz ammo with excitement: the ammo was finally on its way. His workday at an end, he got in his new Audi A4 and drove home through the warm South Florida spring evening, windows open, U2&#x2019;s &#x201c;Beautiful Day&#x201d; blasting on the stereo. What was happening was incredible to Packouz. He had no training as an international arms dealer, other than what he&#x2019;d learned on the job from his friend, the twenty-one-year-old dynamo Efraim Diveroli. Packouz was only twenty-five years old, and his only postsecondary education was half a bachelor&#x2019;s degree&#x2019;s worth of chemistry credits, along with the diploma he&#x2019;d earned from the Educating Hands School of Massage; until recently, he&#x2019;d made his living as a masseur advertising his services on Craigslist. Now Packouz was a central player in the delivery of an entire arsenal to Afghanistan, responsible for chartering dozens of flights from all over Eastern Europe, obtaining flyover permissions from countries like Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and placating overwhelmed American soldiers on bombed-out tarmacs in Kabul trying to build the Afghan army in the midst of a hot war.<br> <br>Winning the $300 million Afghan deal was changing Packouz&#x2019;s life in myriad ways. He&#x2019;d moved out of his dive studio apartment, into a condo in a flashy seaside building called the Flamingo. According to his calculations, he was about to become a multimillionaire. And that was just the beginning. Soon he was going to have enough money to kick-start his dream of a career as a rock musician. No more fending off the advances of massage clients who assumed he was a prostitute. No more self-doubt. No more existential angst. Soon he was going to be rich&#x2014;and he was going to be famous.<br> <br>Arriving home at his condo, Packouz packed the cone of his new Volcano electronic bong, took a deep hit, and felt the pressures of the day drift away into a clean, crisp high. Dinner was at Sushi Samba, a hipster Asian-Latino fusion joint. Packouz was exhausted but exhilarated&#x2014;the improbable turn his life was taking was thrilling, even if it required extremely hard work. As his miso-marinated Chilean sea bass arrived, his cell phone rang.<br> <br>The freight-forwarding agent they&#x2019;d hired was calling from New York and he sounded panicked: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a problem. The plane has been seized on the runway in Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyz secret service won&#x2019;t let it take off for Kabul.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; Packouz said, straining to hear over the restaurant&#x2019;s pounding music.<br> <br>&#x201c;Local customs and security personnel&#x2014;the local KGB&#x2014;are fucking with us. They won&#x2019;t explain anything. I need diplomatic intervention from the United States.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s bullshit!&#x201d; Packouz shouted. &#x201c;We worked for weeks to get the permits.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Kyrgyz KGB is blackmailing us. They say you have to pay a three-hundred-thousand-dollar fine for every day the plane sits on the runway.&#x201d;<br> <br>Packouz was baffled, stoned, unable to grasp the implications of what he was being told. He had no idea that the ammo he was attempting to ship to Afghanistan was now a bargaining chip in a game of geopolitical brinksmanship between George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin. The Russian president didn&#x2019;t like NATO expanding into Eastern Europe, nor did old-school Communist elements inside the Kyrgyz intelligence apparatus. The United States was also being extorted to pay a higher rent for its use of the Bishkek airport as a refueling and staging area&#x2014;a vital strategic link for the war in Afghanistan. Then there was the recently imposed ban on Russian companies&#x2019; selling arms to the US government, denying the Russians the chance to compete for the huge Afghan ammunition contract. The Russians were orchestrating a tit-for-tat reaction, it appeared; it was known in global arms circles that the Afghans were running out of ammunition, so slowing the supply line was a devilish way to hurt American interests.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was surreal,&#x201d; Packouz recalled. &#x201c;Here I was dealing with matters of international security and I was half-baked. I didn&#x2019;t know anything about the situation in that part of the world. But I was a central player in the Afghan War&#x2014;and if our ammo didn&#x2019;t make it to Kabul the entire strategy of building up the Afghanistan army was going to fail. It was totally killing my buzz. But I had to get my shit together. I had to put on my best arms-dealer face.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stepping outside the restaurant, Packouz cupped a hand over his cell phone to shut out the noise. &#x201c;Tell the Kyrgyz KGB that ammo needs to get to Afghanistan right now,&#x201d; he shouted into the phone. &#x201c;This contract is part of a vital mission in the global war on terrorism. Tell them that if they fuck with us they&#x2019;re fucking with the government of the United States!&#x201d;<br> <br>Hanging up, panicking, Packouz decided he needed to talk to Efraim Diveroli, the leader of their operation. Diveroli was asleep in his hotel in Tirana when Packouz reached him. Still groggy from a long night of carousing, Diveroli was sleeping next to a prostitute who&#x2019;d been provided to him by an Albanian businessman hoping to ingratiate himself with the young American gunrunner.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have an emergency,&#x201d; Packouz said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dude, I&#x2019;m sleeping,&#x201d; Diveroli replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Our plane got seized in Kyrgyzstan,&#x201d; Packouz said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Our plane was seized?&#x201d; Diveroli said. &#x201c;What the fuck you talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Hungarian ammo. Kyrgyz intelligence is saying we don&#x2019;t have the right paperwork to transit through their country. They say we&#x2019;ll be fined three hundred grand for every day we&#x2019;re stuck there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Diveroli was now fully awake.<br> <br>&#x201c;Three hundred thousand dollars a day?&#x201d; Diveroli asked, shouting into the phone. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s insane. What the fuck is going on? Tell them this is a vital mission in the war on terror. Tell them that if they fuck with us they&#x2019;re fucking with the United States of America.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah, I said that. I&#x2019;m going to call the American embassy when it&#x2019;s morning there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You got to fix this. We can&#x2019;t afford this kind of shit. This is unfuckingacceptable. Call the State Department, call the Pentagon&#x2014;call anyone you can think of. Go over to Kyrgyzstan and give those mobsters a fucking blow job if you have to. Do whatever it takes to get this resolved&#x2014;and I mean whatever it takes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on it,&#x201d; Packouz said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know I can&#x2019;t help from here&#x2014;I got enough troubles dealing with the fucking Albanian mafia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get to the Kyrgyz.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Now if you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I&#x2019;m going to get back to fucking this hooker,&#x201d; Diveroli concluded.<br> <br>/ / / / /<br> <br>To observe that these kids from Miami Beach&#x2014;still in their early twenties&#x2014;were in over their heads would be an understatement.<br> <br>Despite their youth, all three of the dudes were highly capable, in their different ways. Efraim Diveroli was little short of a genius when it came to bidding on federal contracts and mastering the intricacies of dealing with the Pentagon&#x2019;s bureaucracy. David Packouz was inventive and steady under stress. Alex Podrizki, the only one with a college degree and a modicum of military experience, was taciturn, cautious, determined to ensure that none of the ammo they shipped to Afghanistan was substandard.<br> <br>But they had no real experience, training, or preparation to fulfill a contract as complex and vital as the $300 million Afghanistan deal. Giant international conglomerates had entire departments staffed by military veterans designed to fulfill contracts like the one the dudes were working on. The Pentagon had established the Defense Acquisition University in the 1990s and trained thousands of specialists in the arcane world of military procurements, an industry rife with the perils of fraud and political intrigue. Scores of small companies were also competing for the Army&#x2019;s contracts in Afghanistan and Iraq, almost all run by men in their forties and fifties with arms-dealing experience and connections inside the military. To their rivals, the kids had been a joke at first, but then they&#x2019;d become a major threat because of their uncanny ability to win contracts by underbidding the competition.<br> <br>The story of how the three dudes exploded onto the international arms-dealing scene began three years earlier, in the summer of 2004. At the tender age of eighteen, Efraim Diveroli had resolved improbably&#x2014;but with true fervor&#x2014;to turn himself into a gunrunner. Diveroli and his pals David Packouz and Alex Podrizki had met as teenagers at a yeshiva in Miami Beach, where they routinely skipped prayers to smoke dope in a nearby abandoned house. They belonged to a posse of Orthodox Jewish kids who styled themselves as grunge punks. Chasing around the Art Deco hotels of Miami, their gang rejected the strictures of religious life for the pleasures and distractions of modern American youth. Until the youngest of their gang, Efraim Diveroli, stumbled onto the idea of making money from America&#x2019;s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan&#x2014;and drew his friends into the nascent arms business he was going to construct.<br> <br>&#x201c;When I started working with Efraim, I knew nothing about war,&#x201d; David Packouz recalled. &#x201c;I knew about the so-called global war on terror. But I&#x2019;m talking about the business of war&#x2014;because that&#x2019;s what it was, a business. It turned out that I had a great teacher in Efraim. He was only a kid, but arms dealing came naturally to him. He had an uncle who dealt arms, so the business was kind of in his family, but nothing like the level he took it to. Efraim was born to be a gunrunner.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the time, the eighteen-year-old Diveroli was living near the beach in a back-room studio apartment he rented from a Hispanic family. Wake and bake was his daily ritual. The buzz from a couple of hits on the bong he kept on the kitchen table helped him focus as he spent the morning scanning the website Federal Business Opportunities, or FedBizOpps, as it was known in the arms-dealing trade. Here the US government publicly posted contracts for goods and services that were open to online bidding, including billions of dollars&#x2019; worth of weapons. At lunchtime, Diveroli would take a walk to smoke a joint, then return to hunt for his first arms deal&#x2014;one he might actually have a chance of winning. For months he worked deep into the night, searching, smoking, searching, smoking. Once a week or so, he&#x2019;d meet up with Packouz and Podrizki and their other friends to hit the nightclubs along the beach to blow off steam, downing shots of Grey Goose, snorting lines of coke, hoping to get lucky.<br> <br>To the outside world, the Miami Beach kids might have looked like any other rabble of layabouts. But Efraim Diveroli wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary rebellious teenager; he was an incredibly talented businessman. What Diveroli possessed&#x2014;and what possessed him&#x2014;was a single-minded ambition. He didn&#x2019;t regard FedBizOpps as a way to make money, though getting rich was supremely important to him. The website represented a deeper desire. The contracts posted on FedBizOpps were for rivets and forklifts and generators, but also for guns, grenades, and rocket launchers. Contracts were referred to as opportunities, but the term hardly captured their significance for Diveroli. Underneath the tedious-looking technical specifications and bureaucratic boilerplate, he saw the chance to live out his dream to become an international arms dealer.<br> <br>Like most any teenage dude living on his own, Diveroli&#x2019;s home was a sty, with dishes piled in the sink, dirty laundry tossed everywhere, and nothing in the fridge apart from beer and leftover take-out food. He dressed like a slob, wearing the cheapest jeans and T-shirts he could find. His shock of brown hair was always messy, framing a face with dark brows, a large nose, peach fuzz on his cheeks and chin, and an expression that combined class-clown humor with punk defiance.<br> <br>All day every day, Diveroli parsed the Pentagon&#x2019;s website looking for a way to obtain deals. The bidding on FedBizOpps was winner take all, so there was no consolation for coming close. Diveroli knew winning even one competition would require patience and persistence. But it cost nothing but time to bid on federal solicitations&#x2014;and he had plenty of time on his hands. To Diveroli, competing on FedBizOpps was like rolling the dice in a vast game of craps.<br> <br>One morning in the summer of 2004, Diveroli came across a posting for a contract for nine hundred thousand rounds of .223-caliber, fifty-five-gram ball ammunition to supply the Army&#x2019;s Special Operations Command in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Reading the terms of the offer, Diveroli had only a tenuous grasp of the mechanics of defense contracting. Single source, the posting said, which meant there would be only one winner of the contract.

Writing not as an observer of nature but from an intimate knowledge of the wheatfields, hedgerows, and ditches of his village in Northamptonshire, he described animals, insects, trees, rivers, sunlight, and clouds with sublime sensitivity.

Earthquakes happen without warning, stock markets fluctuate, weather forecasters seldom seem to get it right - even other people continue to baffle us. How do we make sense of it all?

White&#x2019;s <em>The Once and Future King</em>, and the Lerner and Loewe musical <em>Camelot</em>. It might also be argued that the late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century tradition of fantasy literature&#x2015;from Tolkien&#x2019;s <em>Lord of the Rings</em> to George Lucas&#x2019;s <em>Star Wars</em> and beyond&#x2015;owes much to the Arthurian tradition, rooted in English most strongly in Malory&#x2019;s <em>Morte Darthur</em>. Yet there has been no edition that draws on the results of the past generation&#x2019;s scholarship while presenting Malory&#x2019;s work in a form that is at once true to the original and accessible to the modern reader. </p> <p> This new edition, which expands on the revised and expanded selection of Malory material that will be included in the third edition of <em>The Broadview Anthology of British Literature</em>, is all of those things. The extensive selections include most of the material concerning Launcelot, and all of the <em>Morte</em>&#x2019;s two final tales; the language has been partially modernized to make the text accessible to the modern reader, while retaining the flavor of the original; the text has been carefully prepared from the Winchester manuscript; and the annotations are extensive. </p></p><p><p> Contributing Editor <strong>Maureen Okun</strong> is a professor in the Department of English and Chair of the Department of Liberal Studies at Vancouver Island University.

A great deal is cut, for students and general readers who do not have time to read the whole. But everything truly essential is here, with a proper emphasis on Malory&#x2019;s women, who have fascinated readers since the Victorian era. This will be the edition of choice not only for literary surveys and introductory medieval courses but also for courses in Arthurian literature and in the history of romance and fantasy. I highly recommend this book.&#x201d; &#x2015; Nicholas Watson, Harvard University </p> <p> &#x201c;The new introduction to Malory for <em>The Broadview Anthology of British Literature</em> is excellent.

I was just plain curious: Why would someone dismantle an ancient Scottish monastery, ship it overseas stone by stone, and try to reconstruct it as a retreat center in California?</p><p>Graham poured coffee into a small tin cup and handed it to me. Graceful tendrils of steam rose in the damp early-morning air, the rich aroma mingling with the pungent scents of eucalyptus and dried grasses. The day was just dawning, and we stood alone on the hill. My mutt, named Dog, loped around, sniffing the ground and wagging his shaggy brown tail.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll say this much for your client: He chose an amazing site,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. magical.&#x201d;</p><p>A gently sloping meadow surrounded by lush forest opened onto a view of the faraway Pacific Ocean. Behind us was a gorgeous old Victorian manse; below us was the jobsite, where stones lay in piles or stacked to form partially built walls, as though a fourteenth-century Gothic ruin had materialized right here, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the to-be-assembled pile,&#x201d; said Graham, gesturing to a massive mound. Bright blue chalk marks&#x2014;which I knew corresponded to a coded schema intricate enough to drive a Rubik&#x2019;s Cube expert nuts&#x2014;stood out from the dirt, lichen, and moss clinging to the rough-hewn stones. Carved pieces were scattered among the rectangular blocks: Some were components of columns and vaults, others crude gargoyles and decorative plaques.</p><p>&#x201c;Okeydokey,&#x201d; I said, sipping my coffee. &#x201c;Would those be the suspicious ghost-encrusted stones, then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I get the sense you&#x2019;re not taking this seriously,&#x201d; said Graham.</p><p>&#x201c;They look perfectly innocent to me. Frankly, I&#x2019;d worry more about spiders than ghosts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Some tough ghost buster <i>you</i> are, scared of a few tiny little spiders.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;First off, I have never claimed to be a <i>tough</i> ghost buster. Not even an official ghost buster, really. And I&#x2019;m not scared of spiders per se. But you know how this sort of thing goes: A couple teensy arachnids hitch a ride to America, and next thing you know, they end up devastating California&#x2019;s citrus groves.&#x201d;</p><p>Graham smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always admired your sunny outlook.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a native; I think about such things,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Look what happened with William Randolph Hearst: He imported zebras to roam the grounds of his &#x2018;Castle&#x2019; decades ago, and his rancher neighbors are <i>still</i> dealing with them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What have they got against zebras?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Turns out zebras are rather foul-tempered. Or maybe they&#x2019;re just grumpy about being displaced from their natural habitat. My point is, I&#x2019;m not sure bazillionaires should be allowed to just import whatever they want, willy-nilly. It&#x2019;s asking for trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which brings us back to ghosts. It&#x2019;s gotten so bad the men won&#x2019;t go into the building once the sun goes down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ancient stones like these, in a setting like this. Throw in a little fog and a moonless night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Could be people&#x2019;s imaginations are running away with them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could be. But I think there&#x2019;s more to it. You know I don&#x2019;t say this easily, Mel, but I&#x2019;ve seen a few odd goings-on, myself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You really think your client imported a ghost along with these stones?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe. Is that possible?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. I would have thought a ghost would have remained with the land. But, frankly, I probably know more about spiders than the intricacies of ghost immigration. I&#x2019;ll have to look into it. Does your client have a particular affinity with Scotland? &#x2018;Ellis Elrich&#x2019; doesn&#x2019;t sound Scottish.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201d; said Graham. &#x201c;You could ask him tonight. We&#x2019;re invited to his &#x2018;sherry hour.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a big fan of sherry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just what he calls it. There will be other drinks available.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why call it sherry hour?&#x201d;</p><p>A slow smile spread across Graham&#x2019;s face, and he reached out to pull on a corkscrew curl that had freed itself of my serviceable ponytail.</p><p>&#x201c;I do love your curious mind,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Curious in the sense that I always look for answers? Or in the sense that I&#x2019;m strange?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why limit ourselves to only one interpretation?&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t help but return his smile. After a few years of bitter sniping about men in general, and my romantic prospects in particular, I had been mellowing. Graham was helping me to regain my sense of humor.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; I said, getting back on track. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really feel like going to sherry hour. The man&#x2019;s not my client, after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps we could change that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, about that: The whole project sounds like nothing but trouble to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mel, look at the big picture: Elrich is willing to spend a lot of money on this project. How often does a job of this scope and complexity come along that will implement cutting-edge green building techniques?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not often,&#x201d; I conceded. And it was true that Turner Construction needed work. The high-end historic-home- renovation business in the San Francisco Bay Area had taken a nosedive in the past few months, and while I had so far managed to keep my workers gainfully employed finishing up some residential projects, the principals of Turner Construction&#x2014;my dad, our friend and office manager, Stan, and I&#x2014;had been forced to skip a few paychecks.</p><p>We were in dire need of a new client. An <i>important</i> client. The deeper the pockets, the better. But still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;d already faced enough ill omens for one lifetime. I had been hoping to find a nice, quiet, non-ghost-laden building somewhere to renovate.</p><p>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re the only builder I know with ghost experience,&#x201d; Graham continued.</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be so sure. The builders who ran screaming from this jobsite experienced some ghosts. They just didn&#x2019;t want to admit it.&#x201d;</p><p>While we were talking, workmen had started trickling onto the jobsite, arriving in beat-up Jeeps, muddy Toyotas, and full-sized Ford pickups, a few with grinning dogs in the passenger&#x2019;s seat. Many were Latino, some of whom, I imagined, spoke little English. The rest were a mix of whites, blacks, and a few Asians. They toted lunch boxes, big thermoses of coffee or tea, and carried hard hats tucked under brawny arms. I admired these men&#x2014;like my dad, they showed up every day, worked an honest eight hours, and built our homes and communities.</p><p>One man in jeans, boots, and a plaid jacket made a beeline for us.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s Pete now. He&#x2019;s been running the job,&#x201d; Graham said.</p><p>Dog let out a welcoming &#x201c;woof,&#x201d; wagged his tail, and presented himself for a petting.</p><p>&#x201c;Pete, I&#x2019;d like you to meet Mel Turner, the general director of Turner Construction.&#x201d;</p><p>Pete had the ropy muscles common to those who spent their lives on jobsites, but his slightly batty, wide-open eyes and blond hair, worn long and frizzy, lent him a crazy-professor vibe. A knowledgeable foreman was worth his weight in gold and was allowed to push the conventions a little. Construction tended to attract offbeat personalities&#x2014;like me. It was one of the reasons I liked the business so much: I met a lot of real characters.</p><p>On the other hand, construction also attracted a lot of people with criminal records. Perhaps that was no coincidence.</p><p>&#x201c;Heck of a nice thing to meet you, Mel,&#x201d; Pete said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard a lot about you. You&#x2019;re the ghost gal, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sure. Yep,&#x201d; I stumbled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they call me, the &#x2018;ghost gal.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Graham winced.</p><p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the situation,&#x201d; said Pete with a nod. &#x201c;A lot of folks in this business, well, I don&#x2019;t gotta tell you that they don&#x2019;t care much for woo-woo talk. And I don&#x2019;t either, to tell the truth. But what can I say? I can&#x2019;t deny something&#x2019;s going on, and it&#x2019;s interfering with getting this building done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what might that be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a something. An apparition, I guess it&#x2019;s called. At the back of the sacristy. He&#x2019;s got a, uh&#x2014;What&#x2019;s that really big sword called? Real broad?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A broadsword?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right! He&#x2019;s chased out more than one crew, swingin&#x2019; that thing. These are good men, Mel. They don&#x2019;t scare easy. Also, the folks up at the house have seen lights on down here at night when there shouldn&#x2019;t be, and sometimes there&#x2019;s music.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Speaking as a professional&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That sounds like ghostly behavior to me. It surely does.&#x201d;</p><p>Graham gave me a dirty look.</p><p>&#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, there is that, uh, red thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something red?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Pete&#x2019;s Adam&#x2019;s apple bobbed. &#x201c;Some of the guys think they&#x2019;ve heard a woman in there somewhere. They go in to look around, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they end up staggering out of there, crying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Crying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I swear, they come out, sit down right on the ground, and sob like their dog died. I tell you what: That&#x2019;s a little, whaddayacallit, disconcerting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do they describe it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like I said, it&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. red.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What else?&#x201d; I knew from experience that folks who&#x2019;d had an encounter of the ghostly kind were often unwilling to relate all the details, for fear of sounding foolish. I had learned to be patient.</p><p>Pete shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;Just to clarify&#x2014;they haven&#x2019;t seen any fireballs, have they? I mean, we&#x2019;re not talking dragons here, right?&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t have to look to know they were both gaping at me. People come to me begging for help, but when I ask a few simple clarifying questions, they act like I&#x2019;m making it all up.</p><p>&#x201c;Dragons are a stretch, it&#x2019;s true, but you were talking about a man with a broadsword. According to ancient lore, that could be a knight out to slay a dragon. Dragons breathe red fire.&#x201d; I shrugged. &#x201c;Just a thought.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we should get back to the construction issues.&#x201d; Graham turned to address Pete. &#x201c;Mel was wondering how you&#x2019;re getting around the local codes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised to see unreinforced masonry in earthquake country,&#x201d; I clarified.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, but it&#x2019;s not unreinforced,&#x201d; said Pete. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of the reasons it&#x2019;s taking so long. We&#x2019;re drilling through each stone to insert rebar. Let me show you.&#x201d;</p><p>We walked over to a pile of stones near some heavy equipment, including a massive drill.</p><p>&#x201c;Clever,&#x201d; I said as I inspected the process. &#x201c;But it seems a shame to alter the ancient stones at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hear you. Ellis&#x2014;uh, Mr. Elrich&#x2014;has been adamant on this point: We&#x2019;re to do the least damage possible, even if it takes extra time and money. We&#x2019;ve got an army of stonecutters on-site&#x2014;from Mexico and Europe, mostly. There aren&#x2019;t enough locals with this kind of specialized knowledge of masonry. The master stonemason is from Poland.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. It was common in historic restoration to employ master artisans from Latin America or Europe. Most construction in the United States was of recent origin and utilized new materials and new methods. Proper historic renovation construction required traditional skills and techniques.</p><p>&#x201c;And the rebar reinforcement will pass code?&#x201d;</p><p>I noticed Pete and Graham exchange a glance. Finally, Graham spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;The county inspectors&#x2014;all except one&#x2014;have been cooperative. Wakefield will be a pilot project for the inclusion of green techniques in building. The county commissioners figure if the techniques can be folded into such an ambitious project gracefully, they will be able to convince other builders to follow suit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Makes sense,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It would be great to make this sort of thing a priority&#x2014;good for the local guys for supporting it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As for the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#x201d; Pete said. &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t ask too many questions. Elrich seems to have a way of getting things done.&#x201d;</p><p>Pete&#x2019;s smiling, easygoing facade fell away. I followed his gaze to a red-faced man hurrying toward us, huffing from the effort. Dressed in a three-piece suit, a white shirt, and shiny black shoes, the man was overweight and jowly. He carried a clipboard in one hand and a black computer case in the other, and he did not look happy.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; I whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;Larry McCall,&#x201d; said Graham. &#x201c;County building inspector.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damned thorn in my side, is what he is,&#x201d; grumbled Pete.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Mr</i>. Nolan,&#x201d; shouted McCall. &#x201c;A word with you, if I may.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not supposed to drop in unannounced, <i>Mr</i>. McCall,&#x201d; Pete replied.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drop in anytime I see fit,&#x201d; McCall retorted, scowling. &#x201c;Just because Mr. Elrich considers himself above the law doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m willing to go along with it. I&#x2019;ll sign off on the preliminary inspection when I think it appropriate, and not one moment sooner. This project is <i>not</i> adequately reinforced, as you know very well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As <i>you</i> know very well,&#x201d; Pete said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ve experienced some setbacks. We&#x2019;re addressing them as fast as we can. It just so happens we&#x2019;ve brought in a new consultant, someone experienced in this sort of building.&#x201d;</p><p>Three sets of male eyes turned to me. Only then did I realize Pete was talking about me.</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh, yes. Yes, indeed. I&#x2019;m here to make sure things are done right and proper. Wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way. That&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s an informal code among builders that says inspectors are the enemy. We know full well that a good building inspector can improve public health and safety, foresee problems down the line, and even save lives. I, for one, follow building codes with a religious devotion. Still, when it comes to dealing with inspectors while on the job, builders maintain a united front. If we agree something is wrong, we&#x2019;ll fix it just as soon as Mr. Snoopy leaves the jobsite.</p><p>&#x201c;Who might you be, may I ask?&#x201d; Larry McCall demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;...</p></p><h2>Digestive Health With REAL Food, 2nd Edition, Updated and Expanded</h2><p>Unlike narrow diets that tell you what to eat and what not to eat, the protocol presented in <i>Digestive Health with REAL Food</i>, 2nd Edition explains why certain foods are problematic for some people, and how to determine if they are problematic for you.

There's Meemaw's spooky channeler, ready to give guidance as needed; Sunshine's jilted boyfriend skulking around; a bunch of dogs ready to attack...and Kerrigan, Sunshine's mostly absentee mama, who stars in the kind of video flicks that might even shock Mary Alice.</p></p><p>Anne George (c.____ - 2001) was the Agatha Award-winning author of the <em>Southern Sisters</em> mystery series which culminate in <em>Murder Boogies with Elvis</em>, publishing in August 2001. Like Patricia Anne, she was a happily married former school teacher living in Birmingham, Alabama. Ms. George was also a former Alabama State Poet and a regular contributor to literary publications. During her lifetime she was nominated for several awards, including the Pulitzer. Being a true lady of the Old South, her date of birth will forever be a mystery.Mary Alice and I grinned at each other. We each have three children, all in their thirties now (Dear God! Sister's Marilyn and Freddie, our oldest, would soon be forty!), but with the exception of my middle child, Alan, who has two teenaged boys, none of the others has been in a hurry to produce grandchildren for us to spoil. <p>"Is Sunshine's family going to be there tomorrow night?" I asked. </p><p>"Not her mother. She's out of town. Meemaw will, though." </p><p>"Meemaw?" </p><p>"That's what she called her. Her grandmother." </p><p>"I'm assuming Meemaw has a name." </p><p>Mary Alice frowned. "And I don't know what it is. It was 'Meemaw this' and 'Meemaw that' and I forgot to ask. How do you think I can find out? I hate to introduce her as Meemaw Dabbs. You know? God, I can't believe Ray has done this." </p><p>"It wouldn't be Meemaw Dabbs, anyway. Not if she's Sunshine's mother's mother." </p><p>Mary Alice stirred her tea with her finger. "True." </p><p>From outside, I could hear my old Woofer dog barking. It was too hot for him to be getting excited about anything; I needed to go put some ice in his water bowl. But just at that moment, a cloud crossed the sun. A precursor of the usual late afternoon August thunderstorms. I watched Sister stir her tea; my shoulders ached and I was suddenly very sleepy. </p><p>"Hey!" she said. </p><p>I jumped a mile. </p><p>"Locust Fork's in Blount County, isn't it?" </p><p>"I don't know. Why?" </p><p>"Reckon how many people live there?" </p><p>"Not many, I wouldn't think." </p><p>"I'll bet I know someone who knows Meemaw's name." </p><p>"Who?" </p><p>"Sheriff Reuse. I'll bet that martinet knows everybody's dog's name and if they've had their rabies shots." </p><p>"Call him," I said. "He'll be thrilled to hear from you." My sister and Sheriff Reuse had met the year before when she had gotten a wild hair and bought a country-western bar renamed the Skoot 'n' Boot. Nothing but trouble. Suffice it to say she and Sheriff Reuse were not soul mates. </p><p>"You're being sarcastic, but I bet he'll be happy to hear from me. That man leads a boring life, Patricia Anne." </p><p>"Hmmm." What could I say? </p><p>"Where's your phone book?" </p><p>I located it under the newspaper that was spread on the kitchen counter and followed her into the den. This I wanted to hear. </p><p>I got the one-sided version, of course, but it went some thing like this: </p><p>Mary Alice (butter-melting voice): "Sheriff Reuse? How are you? It's so nice to hear your voice! This is Mary Alice Crane." (Pause. Voice still sweet.) No everything's fine. No, I haven't invested in any more property up there. I know, though I really don't feel responsible for what happened." </p><p>(Long pause. Voice not as sweet.) "What I need to know is if you know a family in Locust Fork by the name of Dabbs." (Pause.) "No, I am not buying their property, I assure you." (Nod.) "Sunshine Dabbs is the child's name. Well, it's Sunshine Crane now. She and my son Ray just got married in Bora Bora." (Pause.) "Bora Bora in the South Pacific." (Another nod.) "Yes. And what I need to know is the grandmother's name. All I know is 'Meemaw' and I'm having a dinner party tomorrow night and it would be embarrassing to have to introduce my new daughter-in-law's grandmother and not know her name." (Pause.) "Yes, my son married Sunshine Dabbs. The dinner is tomorrow night. Of course Meemaw is invited." (Disgusted look at me. Holds the phone away from her ear.) "He's laughing." </p><p>"Sheriff Reuse doesn't laugh." </p><p>"Well, he's putting on a damn good imitation." She handed the phone to me. The sheriff was either laughing, crying, or choking to death. </p><p>"Sheriff Reuse?" I asked. "This is Patricia Anne Hollowell. Is something wrong?" </p><p>"Turkett," he gasped finally. </p><p>"What?" </p><p>"Turkett. Her name is Turkett." </p><p>"Like little turkey? Turkett?" </p><p>"There is a God." The gargling sounds started again and the line went dead. </p><p>Mary Alice and I looked at each other. </p><p>"What on God's earth do you suppose that was about?" she asked. </p><p>"I have no idea. He said there was a God and hung up. Oh, and he said her name was Turkett." </p><p>"What Turkett?" </p><p>"I don't know. He was laughing too hard." I held out the phone. "You want to call him back?" </p><p>"Turkett?" </p><p>"Like little turkey. And then he said there was a God and hung up." </p><p>"Meemaw Turkett?" </p><p>"Maybe Sunshine will say her name." </p><p>Mary Alice put the phone back on the end table. "Shouldn't have called that fool anyway." </p><p>"True." I meant it. </p><p>She got up. "Y'all come about seven. Okay?" </p><p>"I'm looking forward to it," I said truthfully. </p><p>Sister started out the back door. "What are y'all having for supper tonight?" </p><p>"Lean Cuisines if Fred doesn't stop by Morrison's Cafeteria." </p><p>"The paint smells too loud in here to eat anyway." </p><p>"We'll probably take it to the bedroom. Eat in bed." </p><p>"You wish." </p><p>I was shutting the door when she turned around. "Turkett? You're sure?" </p><p>I nodded. </p><p>"Reckon why he was laughing so? There's nothing wrong with that name. Not Smith or Jones, but it's a fine name." </p><p>I shrugged. Sheriff Reuse's laugh had been disconcerting to say the least. </p><p>From the west came the first rumble of thunder. I waved at Mary Alice and shut the door. Meemaw Turkett? I grabbed the paintbrush and climbed back on the counter. Lord! </p><p></p></p><h2>You Will Be Able to Draw by the End of this Book: Colored Pencils</h2><p><br><i>You Will Be Able to Draw by the End of this Book: Colored Pencil</i>s is a combined tutorial and sketchbook that teaches you how to draw in color, and allows you the space to practise on the page through guided exercises in mark-making and drawing.

Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness but of strength. It&#x2019;s also healthy, brave, contagious and sets you free. In this book, Dr. Hallowell not only explains why forgiveness is one of the best things you can do to heal your body and mind; he also offers a practical, four-part plan for achieving it. True stories illustrate the power of forgiveness in real lives, from a wife who forgives the hurtful words of her husband to a mother who forgives the man who kidnapped and murdered her daughter.</p><p>Dr. Edward Hallowell is a psychologist and internationally recognized expert on ADD and other behavioral problems. He is an instructor at Harvard Medical School and director of The Hallowell Center for Cognitive and Emotional Health. He lives near Boston, MA.<p>Part One </p> <p>What Is Forgiveness? </p> <p>Forgiveness Is a Gift You Give to Yourself </p> <p>When a well-known sportswriter in Boston died not too long ago, something terrible happened, a terrible something that happens so often that nobody usually comments on how terrible it is. The terrible thing was that a man who had once been a close friend of the sportswriter stayed away from the funeral. The erstwhile friend was still bitter over a disagreement the two of them had had a couple of years before the sportswriter's death. An argument blew up and burned them both. Resentment took root, and like the weed that it is, it grew fast. Soon, what had been a trusting, fun-filled friendship was overrun by an impenetrable thicket of anger and self-justification. Two men who'd been good friends for years became enemies. As so often happens, one of them died before they could find a way to forgive each other and resume the friendship they both had so much enjoyed. </p> <p>It's hard to find the right word for that situation: sad, silly, tragic, foolish, understandable, spiteful, petty, human, absurd, a waste. In any case, it happens all the time. An action leads to anger, which leads to the end of trust and warmth. Close friends turn into cursed fools. Everybody loses. It is so stupid, so wasteful, so sad, so wrong. </p> <p>What would it have taken for the sportswriter and his friend to make up? That question gnawed at me enough to start me researching and writing this book. Soon I was going to bed and waking up wondering, What does it take for any of us to make up with those we can't forgive? What is it about forgiveness that is so difficult? Even when we know it is in our best interests to do it, we agonize over it. </p> <p>What does it take to forgive? The diplomatic skills of a secretary of state? A miracle from above? Or is forgiveness simply never to be when the deeds are really bad? Is forgiveness of grievous wrongs a naive idea that only superficial sentimentalists unschooled in the ways of the world still believe in? </p> <p>On the other hand, might forgiveness be worth a try? If so, why? How can a normal person do it? </p> <p>Recent research has given us important information about forgiveness. We now have reliable, empirical data, not just our subjective musings. Based on that data, I now know that what happened to the sportswriter and his friend has a practical remedy, as does what happens to the millions upon millions of the rest of us who become stuck in grudges, anger and resentment. </p> <p>Forgiveness is a remedy we rarely use. As a result, we suffer when we don't need to. That sportswriter and his friend could have made up. Like so many of us, they didn't. Instead they dug in, each convinced of the rightness of his position. </p> <p>We've all seen this happen. A spat becomes a grudge becomes a feud becomes a schism. Along with precious heirlooms, parents bequeath to their children resentments they inherited from their parents. Partnerships dissolve over a silly squabble, and great businesses crumble. A murder begets other murders, which beget wars. </p> <p>Why? What about the remedy? Why don't we use that? Isn't forgiveness better than family feuds and failed businesses and ruined friendships and cycles of murders and wars? </p> <p>Well, of course it is. But it is a devilishly difficult remedy to apply. It's so hard to use, we'd sometimes rather die than try, especially when the hurt runs deep and has run for a long time. Millions of dead people have shown us their preference to die rather than forgive. You might logically conclude that forgiveness of great crimes is pretty near impossible, especially if the best of your life has been ruined by what someone else has done. </p> <p>But forgiveness is never impossible. Never. If you manage to do it, you're the one who benefits the most. </p> <p>Still, we tend not to forgive. We get mad at a close friend, carry a grudge and refuse to attend the funeral when the friend dies. That's the way of the world, isn't it&#x2015;this silly, silly world, a world in which we're bent on wasting the best that we have? After a fight, instead of making up, each participant furiously details why he is in the right and the other person is a rotten, no-good, dirty rat&#x2015;even though they loved each other just days before, not to mention the years and years before that. </p> <p>All of a sudden, for us stubborn humans, being right becomes more important than being close. It becomes more important to justify our case than to make peace. We invest our energies in defaming the other person, the very same person we recently treasured as a dear friend. What's gained by being so stubborn and self-righteous? I'm not sure what's gained, but whatever it is, we defend it with our lives. </p> <p>In so doing, we can destroy the best of life: friendship and peace. If only we could get better at forgiving, at not taking extreme offense so quickly, at being willing to come back into the room after we have stormed out of it, then we would live longer, happier, less complicated and less foolish lives. We wouldn't waste the best of what we have. </p> <p>We weren't brought up to be as foolish as we become. Most of us were brought up to forgive. The problem is, no one told us how to do it when we were children, or even why we should. Forgiveness was just one of those 'oughtas' we all heard. 'You oughta forgive your brother.' 'You oughta forgive your friend.' But since we weren't told how, we had to wait for forgiveness to appear, as if by magic. </p> <p>Of course, we didn't hold our breaths. We really didn't care very much, because we didn't know why forgiving was such a good thing, other than that parents and teachers and religious people recommended it. While they recommended it, we couldn't help but notice they usually didn't practice it. So we turned to what came to us naturally and was a lot more exciting: holding grudges and seeking revenge. </p> <p>I have since found out that it is worth learning the act of forgiveness, even though it never comes naturally. Now that I have grown up and become a doctor and actually researched the topic, I have learned a lot. The grown-ups back when I was a kid may not have known the hows and whys of forgiveness, but, like a good night's sleep or a balanced diet, they were right to recommend it. Medically speaking, it is really good for you to forgive. It's much, much better than holding a grudge or seeking revenge. Learning how to forgive ranks near the top of the practical steps you can take to improve your life, your physical health and your emotional health. Furthermore, the price is good; it's free. </p> <p>It's also freeing. When you forgive, you free yourself from mind-forged manacles. You start to derive benefits as soon as you gain release from the anger and resentment that have held you down. </p> <p>Among the many health benefits, your blood pressure may go down, your resting heart rate may decrease, your immune system may get stronger, your susceptibility to a heart attack or a stroke may decrease, headaches and backaches and neck pain may abate, your need for medications may diminish, and even your sexual self may gain strength. If this sounds like a lot, it actually isn't anywhere near a complete list of the potential physical benefits of forgiveness. </p> <p>I haven't even mentioned the emotional benefits. Forgiving lifts your spirits. It makes you feel happier, and it clarifies your thinking. No longer must you carry a lodestone of anger and resentment. The lift returns to your step, and your day does not dawn in a shadow of grievance. </p> <p>Compared to other measures people take to improve their lives, forgiving is at least as good for you as losing weight, getting the right amount of sleep, taking supplemental vitamins or wearing seat belts. However, as I have mentioned, forgiving is hard to learn to do. We need help. </p> <p>Unlike most other steps we can take toward a better life, there isn't much written to offer us help on how to forgive. We find we're still where we were when we were growing up: lots of people recommend forgiving, but they neither tell us how to do it nor do they show us in their own lives. </p> <p>I want to change that. </p> <p>Here's good news. However difficult it may be, forgiving is a skill anyone can learn. If you have the desire and are willing to practice, you can learn how to do it, even if you're a stubborn alpha male! While mystery may surround forgiveness, and while magic or grace or luck may propel it, forgiveness is nonetheless a skill that anyone can acquire if they want to. I offer many examples in this book. </p> <p>But first, let me tell you a story about forgiveness that ironically illustrates the dangers of avoiding it. I have a friend in Seattle who hates the man he used to work for. He has hated him for years. He hates him because this man humiliated him, publicly firing him in a hideously demeaning way. To make it worse, my friend had once considered this man his buddy, often going out drinking with him, and to ball games and dinners. Then, out of nowhere, the man turned on my friend and betrayed him, setting him up to take the fall for business mistakes he, not my friend, had made. Ever since then, not a day passed in my friend's life without his thinking of his old boss and filling up with rage. Five years passed. </p> <p>Late one night, my friend was walking down the street where the man he hated lives. As he drew near the house, the familiar hateful feelings took over. He started to recall the details of what happened, the peremptory e-mail, the refusal to discuss the matter, the public announcement at a motivational rally at work that my friend had 'failed to meet expectations in a company committed to meeting expectations,' followed by the public request&#x2015;blared over loudspeakers&#x2015;that my friend leave the meeting immediately, pick up his belongings at the front desk and never return. Even though the events had happened five years before, it still felt fresh and cruel and wrong. </p> <p>On this particular night, as he walked past his old boss's house, my friend decided to do something. Nothing major&#x2015;just something. He had never been able to take any revenge at all, even though he thought about it at least once a day, sometimes more. Although he'd thought about it a lot, he knew he would never do anything big, like hire a hit man to kill his old boss, or cleverly slander him or set him up in an embarrassing tryst. That wasn't my friend's style. But tonight, just for the fun of it, he decided to do something small, something he could easily get away with, something that would do no serious harm but would make him feel good, at least for a minute or two. He decided to do what kids have been doing for years to neighbors they hate. He decided to throw a rock through a window in his old boss's house. It was childish and silly, but the idea felt as good as a strong drink. </p> <p>Kicking around in the dirt that bordered the sidewalk, my friend looked for the proper stone as this emerging David imagined, if not slaying his own Goliath, then at least bothering him a bit. He told me later that he carefully chose a jagged rock, big enough to do some damage, but small enough to throw hard. Once he found his stone, he wound up and let it fly, rage propelling the rock out of depths of humiliation up into the moonlight toward a corner window of the house of the hated man. For a moment, my friend felt happy. Victorious. Avenged. </p> <p>But his aim was not David's. Instead of smashing the window, the rock hit a drain pipe right next to the window and ricocheted back. My friend, standing on the sidewalk below, his face eagerly upturned, grinning, expecting to savor this moment, suddenly became the target of the very rock he had thrown. Unable to duck in time, he took the ricochet head-on, as if he had planned to be hit by it all along. The stone struck him on the bridge of his nose, slicing open a cut that took several weeks to heal fully. </p> <p>He felt foolish, humiliated by this man once again, as he held his arm up to his bleeding nose and hurried home. When he told me about it he laughed, but it was clear that he did not enjoy this bit of laughter. He was the victim of his own hatred. </p> <p>I wanted to tell him something that Confucius said, but it didn't seem tactful to say it just then. Confucius said, 'When you start down the road to revenge, first dig two graves.' </p> <p>If my friend had found a way to forgive his old boss before he took his walk that night, his nose would have been spared, not to mention his pride. But, like all of us sometimes, my friend couldn't forgive. </p> <p>Most of us don't like to forgive. I don't know anyone who does. It's not fun, and it's difficult. When the stakes are high, forgiving can seem as difficult as performing surgery on yourself, and equally painful. Just thinking about forgiving can make you wince and say, 'No way.' </p> <p>Yet in this book I will urge you to try it. Why? Think of my friend who threw the rock. Think how his hatred of his ex-boss owned him and tormented him. Taking a stroll at night, he plotted revenge instead of enjoying the summer breeze. Imagine how many moments in his life had become contaminated with those toxic feelings. Imagine how much time he gave over to nursing his anger and keeping it alive. Through it all, he was the only person who suffered. That is the pitiful irony in being unable to forgive. You are the one who gets hurt. </p> <p>I wish I could have told my friend how to forgive, but who was I to say what he should do? I was not the person who had been fired, humiliated and betrayed. </p> <p>I wish I could have told him stories from my own life, or given him the scientific facts I knew from my own medical training about the physical danger of carrying grudges and resentments. I wish I could have told him what I have put into this book, information that could have made his life so much better. I did try, but when I tried, he listened to me no more closely than if I had been a flight attendant announcing how to fasten a seat belt. </p> <p>In this book, I am going to make another attempt, this time in writing, to explain why and how to forgive. </p> <p>Perhaps you consider your own case so special, the offense so dire or the situation so complex, that no book or other advice could help. But we all think our own anger is special. The longer you nurse it, the longer you keep it in your heart, the more parasitic it becomes. It grows more powerful as it drains you of your health, gradually turning you into a nasty creature like itself. You feed it with your brooding and pacing and clenching of your teeth. Reliving in your mind what happened to make you so angry, you revive your hurt over and over again, each time refeeling your rage and refining your visions of revenge. Gradually, you ruin your sense of joy in life, which is bad for you in every conceivable way. </p> <p>To put an end to it, you need a radical cure, a cure that reaches in and takes hold of the parasite of rage and rips it away from what it's sucking on: the walls of your own heart. Forgiveness, not revenge, is the only radical cure. </p> <p>When you forgive, you cut the parasite from its food supply. Now you can watch it wither and slowly die. </p> <p>Forgiveness is a gift you give to others, but it also a gift you give to yourself. </p> <p>Question: How can I keep the peace i...</p></p><h2>Pentimento (Back Bay Books)</h2><p>In this widely praised follow-up to her National Book Award-winning first volume of memoirs, An Unfinished Woman, the legendary playwright Lillian Hellman looks back at some of the people who, wittingly or unwittingly, exerted profound influence on her development as a woman and a writer. The portraits include Hellman&#39;s recollection of a lifelong friendship that began in childhood, reminiscences that formed the basis of the Academy Award-winning film Julia.</p><p>"Lillian Hellman (1905-1984) is best known as the author of the plays The Children's Hour, The Little Foxes, Watch on the Rhine, Another Part of the Forest, The Autumn Garden, and Toys in the Attic. She also wrote three volumes of autobiography: An Unfinished Woman, for which she received the National Book Award in 1969, Pentimento, and Scoundrel Time. <p>Wendy Wasserstein is a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright whose works include An American Daughter, The Sisters Rosenzweig,The Heidi Chronicles, Isn't It Romantic, and Uncommon Women and Others."</p>Hellman's 1973 title was the second of three volumes of memoirs written after she had dried up as a playwright. These remembrances have come under fire by many who claim she lifted some of these stories from others, such as the famous "Julia" chapter upon which the film was based, and completely invented others.

At noon, the Guard moved out. Twenty-four minutes later, Guardsmen launched a 13-second, 67-shot barrage that left four students dead and nine wounded, one paralyzed for life. The story doesn't end there, though. A horror of far greater proportions was narrowly averted minutes later when the Guard and students reassembled on the Commons.<br><br>The Kent State shootings were both unavoidable and preventable: unavoidable in that all the discordant forces of a turbulent decade flowed together on May 4, 1970, on one Ohio campus; preventable in that every party to the tragedy made the wrong choices at the wrong time in the wrong place.<br><br>Using the university's recently available oral-history collection supplemented by extensive new interviewing, Means tells the story of this iconic American moment through the eyes and memories of those who were there, and skillfully situates it in the context of a tumultuous era.<br></p><p><b>Howard Means</b> is the author or coauthor of ten books, including the first biography of Colin Powell and Louis Freeh's bestselling memoir <i>My FBI</i>.

Peter Woit argues that string theory isn't just going in the wrong direction, it's not even science. <i>Not Even Wrong</i> shows that what many physicists call superstring theory&#x201d; is not a theory at all. It makes no predictions, not even wrong ones, and this very lack of falsifiability is what has allowed the subject to survive and flourish. Peter Woit explains why the mathematical conditions for progress in physics are entirely absent from superstring theory today, offering the other side of the story.</p><p><b>Peter Woit</b> is a lecturer in the mathematics department of Columbia University, where in recent years he has taught graduate courses in quantum field theory, representation theory, and differential geometry. His math and physics blog, Not Even Wrong (www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress), has been featured in <i>Discover</i>, <i>Seed</i>, and <i>New Scientist</i>. He lives in New York.String theory is the only game in town in physics departments these days. But echoing Lee Smolin's forthcoming <i>The Trouble with Physics</i> (Reviews, July 24), Woit, a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and a lecturer in mathematics at Columbia, points out&#x2014;again and again&#x2014;that string theory, despite its two decades of dominance, is just a hunch aspiring to be a theory. It hasn't predicted anything, as theories are required to do, and its practitioners have become so desperate, says Woit, that they're willing to redefine what doing science means in order to justify their labors. The first half of Woit's book is a tightly argued, beautifully written account of the development of the standard model and includes a history of particle accelerators that will interest science buffs. When he gets into the history of string theory, however, his pace accelerates alarmingly, with highly sketchy chapters. Reading this in conjunction with Smolin's more comprehensive critique of string theory, readers will be able to make up their own minds about whether string theory lives up to the hype. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But in short order he befriended (and bedded) the rich and celebrated and in the process conquered the world. No less an august figure than the young Gore Vidal was enchanted by Denny's special charms. He twice modeled characters on Denny in his fiction, saying it was a pity that Denny never wrote a memoir. To Vidal he was &#x201c;un homme fatal.&#x201d; Truman Capote, who devoted a third of Answered Prayers to Denny's life story, found that &#x201c;to watch him walk into a room was an experience. He was beyond being good-looking; he was the single most charming-looking person I've ever seen.&#x201d; Writer Christopher Isherwood was more to the point: he called Denny &#x201c;the most expensive male prostitute in the world.&#x201d; In his short life, Denny achieved a mythic status, and Best-Kept Boy in the World for the first time follows him into his rarefied world of barons and shipping tycoons, lords, princes, heirs of great fortunes, artists, and authors. Here is the story of an American original, a story with an amazing cast of unforgettable characters and extraordinary settings, the book Gore Vidal wished Denny had written.</p><p>Arthur Vanderbilt is the author of many books of history, biography, memoirs, and essays. He lives in New Jersey and Massachusetts.Preface<br><br>It was a pity, Gore Vidal once remarked, that Denham Fouts never wrote a memoir. Vidal described Denny as "un homme fatal".<br><br>Truman Capote found that "to watch him walk into a room was an experience. He was beyond being good-looking; he was the single most charming-looking person I've ever seen." Capote loved to conjecture that "had Denham Fouts yielded to Hitler's advances there would have been no World War Two".<br><br>Jimmie Daniels, the nightclub singer who performed at his own Harlem club that bore his name, thought Denny "was about the most beautiful boy anybody had ever seen. His skin always looked as if it had just been scrubbed; it seemed to have no pores at all, it was so smooth."<br><br>To King Paul of Greece he was "my dear Denham" or "Darling Denham", and the King's telegrams to Denny from the Royal Palace always were signed "love Paul".<br><br>Peter Watson, the wealthy financial backer of the popular British literary magazine Horizon, had an erection whenever he was in the same room with Denny.<br><br>The artist Michael Wishart met Denny for the first time at a party in Paris and realized instantly he was in love and that "the only place in the world I wanted to be was in Denham's bedroom".<br><br>Best-selling author Glenway Wescott thought Denny "absolutely enchanting and ridiculously good-looking. . . . He had the most delicious body odor; I once swiped one of his handkerchiefs."<br><br>Lord Tredegar, one of the largest landowners in Great Britain, saw Denny being led by the police through the lobby of an expensive hotel on Capri, convinced the police to let him pay the bills Denny owed, and then took Denny to accompany him and his wife as they continued on their tour of the world.<br><br>Christopher Isherwood, who Denny considered his best friend, called him "the most expensive male prostitute in the world".<br><br>Today, someone who projects such an instant and potent power of attraction could forge a successful career, perhaps as a male model, as a character in a daytime soap opera, as a tabloid celebrity, as a television or movie star, maybe even as an acclaimed actor. But Denny was born in 1914 when such options were not yet available to those rare individuals endowed with this sort of sexual magnetism. He never did write a memoir that would have told his strange story, that may have explained how it felt to possess those magical powers, to occupy the thoughts of another, to become the obsession of their lives. How would it feel to be Aschenbach's Tadzio in Thomas Mann's Death in Venice? To be Humbert's Lolita in Nabokov's masterpiece? Jay Gatsby's Daisy in The Great Gatsby?<br><br>"The mass of men," Thoreau was brave enough and honest enough to write in Walden, "lead lives of quiet desperation." Most of us come, go, and are gone, our lives lived in shades of gray no more distinguishable, no more memorable, than the squirrels in a park on a coming of winter morning. Denny was one of those rare individuals who, whatever his faults, brought color into the black and white etchings of everyday life.<br><br>Denny never did write his own story, but he does move through many memoirs of the times. And for some of the most renowned authors of those times, he was a muse, and that color he brought into a squirrel-gray world inspired them to capture him in their prose. Denny is "Paul" in Christopher Isherwood's Down There on a Visit. He is a character in Gore Vidal's novel The Judgment of Paris, and in his short story "Pages from an Abandoned Journal". He appears in Truman Capote's infamous Answered Prayers on which the author was working, or not working, when he died. He was proud to find himself a character in Somerset Maugham's The Razor's Edge.<br><br>To be immortalized in a story by a famed author would be enough to earn a footnote in literary history. To have inspired the body of work Denham Fouts did is to become a legend. This is his story.<br>CHAPTER ONE<br><br>It had been a long six years since Peter Watson sent Denny to the United States as the Nazis marched toward Paris. Now, at last, in the Spring of 1946, as weary and war-wounded Europe was beginning to heal, Denny returned to Paris, heading straight to Peter Watson's apartment at 40 Rue du Bac.<br><br>It was a "sombre faubourg apartment with the eighteenth century windows," as one friend described it, where, in paneled rooms that before the War had been filled with sculptures and antiques, Watson had hung the modern masterworks he had been acquiring, a collection of what he felt were the most interesting paintings of each of the artists he was collecting, the best of de Chirico, Gris, Klee, Miro and Picasso. Six servants had managed the enormous apartment which was in an elegant eighteenth century townhouse right off the Boulevard Saint Germain, close to the Seine. It was set back from the street with a private garden behind it, and through the large windows and French doors leading out to a terrace was - - Paris: the Eiffel Tower, the Grand Palais, the roof of the Louvre, the Sacre Coeur, and not far away, Notre Dame and the Jardin du Luxemburg.<br><br>Peter had not been prepared for what he found when, after the War, he and his friend Cyril Connolly returned to Paris in July 1945. When they unlocked and opened the door, they were shocked. "My flat's a shambles", Peter wrote to a friend "- - really heartbreaking and so filthy." His extraordinary art collection (which in today's dollars would have been valued at well over $100 million) had disappeared. What furniture remained was broken, dirty draperies hung in shreds, everything of value was missing, including what little he had hidden before evacuating as the Nazi tanks approached the city. Connolly found the once grand quarters "very dilapidated and buggery" and "terribly depressing, empty of everything, no hot water, no clean sheets . . . My bed is a sofa in the dining room - - nowhere to unpack anything, and I have to go through Peter's room whenever I want to go to the bathroom. It is so strange that Peter, who once had a genius for gracious living now comes to symbolize morbid discomfort to me." For Connolly the flat was "heavily mined" with reminders of his ex-wife Jean; there, still hanging where Jean and Denny had nailed it for Christmas in 1938, was a scraggly piece of dried out mistletoe.<br> <br> Discouraged, depressed by what he found and did not find, Peter nevertheless had worked to prepare the apartment for a party, a special party to celebrate the return to Paris, to him, after six years of separation, the love of his life, his obsession: Denham Fouts.<br><br> One of the guests at Peter's party that evening was Michael Wishart, the seventeen year old grandson of Colonel Sidney Wishart who had been the Sheriff of London, the son of Ernest Wishart who owned an estate in Sussex near the sea, and of the sophisticated, glamorous, free-spirited Lorna, who gave birth to Michael when she was seventeen, and who, whenever possible, sped away from her husband's estate in her chocolate brown Bentley, racing straight for London's nightclubs, and, a series of lovers.<br><br> Michael Wishart would become an artist, a painter of some renown, a precocious talent who was selling his paintings when he was fourteen and had his first exhibition in London, and a well received exhibition at that, at the Archer Gallery at the age of sixteen. He was, in fact, precocious in many respects. Michael was twelve when Great Britain declared war on Germany and Messerschmitts began flying over the English Channel. Those occasional German aviators who managed to parachute from their stricken fighters were captured and put to work by the English. One, not much older than Michael, "blonde and arrogant, the incarnation of a Hitler Youth poster", was brought to work on Michael's family's estate. Michael found intriguingly irresistible this sullen POW named Harm, and when no one was watching, began bringing him small gifts - - cigarettes, chocolates, beer. At that age, Michael already was quite handsome with his thick dark hair and eyebrows, seductive eyes and mouth, cleft chin, baritone voice. He and the foreign laborer could communicate only by glances, but those glances soon became more meaningful and Michael thought he could read in them that "he would follow wherever I led." Michael was correct. One day, as Michael was seated by a stone wall sketching a landscape, the German youth came and sat down next to him. Michael walked with him through the orchards, past classical statuary, through gates in walls and hedges, across fields to an abandoned shed, and there "we made a private truce without waiting for the general armistice to be declared., for which I feel toward him nothing but gratitude." It must have been quite a private armistice with Harm. Forty years later, and an extremely sexually active four decades they were, Michael would write that "I have never since experienced physical desire comparable to that which I felt for the German POW." He added that "thanks to him, and his silk parachute, I can say that homosexuality came to me, quite literally, 'out of the blue'". At the time, though, Michael was alarmed about what he had done and about what he was feeling, and wasted no time seeking a psychiatrist to determine what was wrong with him and to cure him. After a number of unsatisfying sessions, the psychiatrist left him with these words: "well, old fellow, remember that variety is the spice of life."<br><br> Truly words to live by. And live by them Michael did. Throughout his life, his affairs with women were as passionate as those with men, and he moved back and forth between the sexes and between partners with abandon.<br><br> The onset of the War created for Michael something of a holiday atmosphere, a time, like summer vacation, when society's rules seemed to go by the wayside. Whenever school was out, he traveled to London. By day, he pursued his art and met other artists. By night, the streets of London were black, an inky darkness shattered by the wail of air raid sirens, by bursts of batteries of anti-aircraft artillery, by the fear...</p><h2>The Christian in an Age of Terror: Sermons for a Time of War</h2><p>Previously unpublished, exceptionally relevant sermons from Lloyd-Jones, one of the twentieth century&#39;s most influential preachers.</p><p>D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones has been described as &#x201c;a great pillar of the twentieth century evangelical church.&#x201d; His spiritual leadership and reputation for &#x201c;full-blooded gospel preaching&#x201d; has left a legacy around the world that continues to this day.</p><h2>Diary of a Foreigner in Paris (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><b>Experience postwar Europe through the diary of a fascinating and witty twentieth-century writer and artist. Recording his travels in France and Switzerland, Curzio Malaparte encounters famous figures such as Cocteau and Camus and captures the fraught, restless spirit of Paris after the trauma of war.</b><br><br> In 1947 Curzio Malaparte returned to Paris for the first time in fourteen years. In between, he had been condemned by Mussolini to five years in exile and, on release, repeatedly imprisoned. In his intervals of freedom, he had been dispatched as a journalist to the Eastern Front, and though many of his reports from the bloodlands of Poland and Ukraine were censored, his experiences there became the basis for his unclassifiable postwar masterpiece and international bestseller, <i>Kaputt</i>. Now, returning to the one country that had always treated him well, the one country he had always loved, he was something of a star, albeit one that shines with a dusky and disturbing light.&nbsp;<br><br> The journal he kept while in Paris records a range of meetings with remarkable people&#x2014;Jean Cocteau and a dourly unwelcoming Albert Camus among them&#x2014;and is full of Malaparte&#x2019;s characteristically barbed reflections on the temper of the time. It is a perfect model of ambiguous reserve as well as humorous self-exposure. There is, for example, Malaparte&#x2019;s curious custom of sitting out at night and barking along with the neighborhood dogs&#x2014;dogs, after all, were his only friends when in exile. The French find it puzzling, to say the least; when it comes to Switzerland, it is grounds for prosecution!</p><p><b>Curzio Malaparte</b> (pseudonym of Kurt Eric Suckert, 1898-1957) was born in Prato, Italy, and served in World War I. An early supporter of the Italian Fascist movement and a prolific journalist, Malaparte soon established himself as an outspoken public figure. In 1931 he incurred Mussolini's displeasure by publishing a how-to manual entitled <i>Technique of the Coup-d'Etat</i>, which led to his arrest and a brief term in prison. During World War II Malaparte worked as a correspondent, for much of the time on the eastern front, and this experience provided the basis for his two most famous books, <i>Kaputt</i> (1944) and <i>The Skin</i> (1949), both available as NYRB Classics. His political sympathies veered to the left after the war. He continued to write, while also involving himself in the theater and the cinema.<br><br><b>Stephen Twilley</b> is the managing editor of <i>Public Books</i>.

He was deep in concentration, tongue pinched between his teeth, as he steeled himself for combat with the stuffed black bear that ruled the front corner of my master&#x2019;s shop. Tom stripped off his linen shirt and flung it heroically across the antimony cups gleaming on the display table near the fire. From the oak shelf nearest to him, he snatched the glazed lid of an apothecary jar&#x2014;Blackthorn&#x2019;s Wart-Be-Gone, according to the scrawl on the label&#x2014;and held it on guard, a miniature ceramic shield. In his right hand, the rolling pin wobbled threateningly.<br> <br>Tom Bailey, son of William the Baker, was the finest fake soldier I&#x2019;d ever seen. Though only two months older than me, he was already a foot taller, and built like a blacksmith, albeit a slightly pudgy one, due to a steady pilfering of his father&#x2019;s pies. And in the safety of my master&#x2019;s shop, away from the horrors of battle like death, pain, or even a mild scolding, Tom&#x2019;s courage held no equal.<br> <br>He glared at the inanimate bear. The floorboards creaked as he stepped within range of its wickedly curved claws. Tom shoved the curio cabinet aside, making the brass balances jingle. Then he hoisted his flour-dusted club in salute. The frozen beast roared back silently, inch-long teeth promising death. Or several minutes of tedious polishing, at least.<br> <br>I sat on the counter at the back, legs dangling, and clicked leather heels against the carved cedar. I could be patient. You had to be, sometimes, with Tom, whose mind worked as it pleased.<br> <br>&#x201c;Think you can steal my sheep, Mr. Bear?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you no quarter this day.&#x201d; Suddenly, he stopped, rolling pin held outward in midlunge. I could almost see the clockwork cranking between his ears. &#x201c;Wait. What?&#x201d; He looked back at me, puzzled. &#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s build a cannon,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just what you think it means. You and me. Build a cannon. You know.&#x201d; I spread my hands. &#x201c;Boom?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom frowned. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because people can&#x2019;t just build cannons, Christopher.&#x201d; He said it like he was explaining why you shouldn&#x2019;t eat fire to a small, dull child.<br> <br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s where cannons come from,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;People build them. You think God sends cannons down from heaven for Lent?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d;<br> <br>I folded my arms. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand why you&#x2019;re not more excited about this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe that&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;re never the one on the pointy end of your schemes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What schemes? I don&#x2019;t have any schemes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I spent all night throwing up that &#x2018;strength potion&#x2019; you invented,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>He did look a little dark under the eyes today. &#x201c;Ah. Yes. Sorry.&#x201d; I winced. &#x201c;I think I put in too much black snail. It needed less snail.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What it needed was less Tom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be such a baby,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Vomiting is good for you, anyway. It balances the humors.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like my humors the way they are,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I have a recipe this time.&#x201d; I grabbed the parchment I&#x2019;d leaned against the coin scales on the countertop and waved it at him. &#x201c;A real one. From Master Benedict.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can a cannon have a recipe?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not the whole cannon. Just the gunpowder.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom got very still. He scanned the jars around him, as if among the hundreds of potions, herbs, and powders that ringed the shop was a remedy that would somehow get him out of this. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s illegal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Knowing a recipe isn&#x2019;t illegal,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Making it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was true. Only masters, and only those with a royal charter, were allowed to mix gunpowder. I was a long way from either.<br> <br>&#x201c;And Lord Ashcombe is on the streets today,&#x201d; Tom said.<br> <br>Now that made me pause. &#x201c;You saw him?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom nodded. &#x201c;On Cheapside, after church. He had two of the King&#x2019;s Men with him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d he look like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mean&#x201d; was exactly what I&#x2019;d imagined. Lord Richard Ashcombe, Baron of Chillingham, was King Charles&#x2019;s loyal general, and His Majesty&#x2019;s Warden here in London. He was in the city hunting for a pack of killers. In the past four months, five men had been butchered in their homes. Each of them had been tied up, tortured, then slit open at the stomach and left to bleed to death.<br> <br>Three of the victims had been apothecaries, a fact that had me seeing assassins in the shadows every night. No one was sure what the killers wanted, but sending in Lord Ashcombe meant the king was serious about stopping them. Lord Ashcombe had a reputation for getting rid of men hostile to the Crown&#x2014;usually by sticking their heads on pikes in the public square.<br> <br>Still, we didn&#x2019;t need to be that cautious. &#x201c;Lord Ashcombe&#x2019;s not coming here,&#x201d; I said, as much to myself as to Tom. &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t killed anyone. And the King&#x2019;s Warden isn&#x2019;t likely to stop by for a suppository, is he?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about your master?&#x201d; Tom said.<br> <br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t need a suppository.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom made a face. &#x201c;I mean, isn&#x2019;t he coming back? It&#x2019;s getting close to dinnertime.&#x201d; He said &#x201c;dinnertime&#x201d; with a certain wistfulness.<br> <br>&#x201c;Master Benedict just bought the new edition of Culpeper&#x2019;s herbal,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s at the coffeehouse with Hugh. They&#x2019;ll be gone for ages.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom pressed his ceramic shield to his chest. &#x201c;This is a bad idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hopped down from the counter and grinned.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>To be an apothecary, you must understand this: The recipe is everything.<br> <br>It isn&#x2019;t like baking a cake. The potions, creams, jellies, and powders Master Benedict made&#x2014;with my help&#x2014;required an incredibly delicate touch. A spoonful too little niter, a pinch too much aniseed, and your brilliant new remedy for dropsy would congeal instead into worthless green goo.<br> <br>But new recipes didn&#x2019;t fall from the sky. You had to discover them. This took weeks, months, even years of hard work. It cost a fortune, too: ingredients, apparatus, coal to stoke the fire, ice to chill the bath. Most of all, it was dangerous. Blazing fires. Molten metals. Elixirs that smelled sweet but ate away your insides. Tinctures that looked as harmless as water but threw off deadly, invisible fumes. With each new experiment, you gambled with your life. So a working formula was better than gold.<br> <br>If you could read it.<br> <br>?M08?<br> <br>02160911101825261310092611221315240322132410220710092611221315141607011613010417261122131514142207151126152613021304092514261122132215260720080419<br> <br>Tom scratched his cheek. &#x201c;I thought there&#x2019;d be more words and things.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in code,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He sighed. &#x201c;Why is it always in code?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because other apothecaries will do anything to steal your secrets. When I have my own shop,&#x201d; I said proudly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m putting everything in code. No one&#x2019;s going to swipe my recipes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No one will want your recipes. Except poisoners, I suppose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I said I was sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe this is in code,&#x201d; Tom said, &#x201c;because Master Benedict doesn&#x2019;t want anyone to read it. And by &#x2018;anyone,&#x2019; I mean you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He teaches me new ciphers every week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did he teach you this one?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;d planned to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Christopher.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I figured it out. Look.&#x201d; I pointed at the notation ?M08?. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a substitution cipher. Every two numbers stand for one letter. This tells you how to swap them. Start with &#x2018;08,&#x2019; and replace it with M. Then count forward. So 08 is M, 09 is N, and so on. Like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>I showed him the table I&#x2019;d worked out.<br> <br>A<br> <br>20<br> <br>B<br> <br>21<br> <br>C<br> <br>22<br> <br>D<br> <br>23<br> <br>E<br> <br>01<br> <br>F<br> <br>02<br> <br>G<br> <br>03<br> <br>H<br> <br>04<br> <br>I<br> <br>05<br> <br>K<br> <br>06<br> <br>L<br> <br>07<br> <br>M<br> <br>08<br> <br>N<br> <br>09<br> <br>O<br> <br>10<br> <br>P<br> <br>11<br> <br>Q<br> <br>12<br> <br>R<br> <br>13<br> <br>S<br> <br>14<br> <br>T<br> <br>15<br> <br>V<br> <br>16<br> <br>X<br> <br>17<br> <br>Y<br> <br>18<br> <br>Z<br> <br>19<br> <br>Tom looked between the cipher and the block of numbers at the top of the page. &#x201c;So if you replace the numbers with the right letters . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . You get your message.&#x201d; I flipped the parchment over to show the translation I&#x2019;d inked on the back.<br> <br>Gunpowder<br> <br>One part charcoal. One part sulfur. Five parts saltpeter.<br> <br>Grind separately. Mix.<br> <br>Which is what we did. We set up on the larger display table, farther from the fireplace, based on Tom&#x2019;s reasonable suggestion that gunpowder and flames weren&#x2019;t friends. Tom moved the bleeding spoons from the table and got the mortars and pestles from the window near the bear while I pulled the ingredient jars from the shelves.<br> <br>I ground the charcoal. Sooty clouds puffed into the air, mixing with the earthy scent of the dried roots and herbs hanging from the rafters. Tom, glancing uneasily at the front door for any sign of my master, took care of the saltpeter, crushing the crystals that looked just like ordinary table salt. The sulfur was already a fine yellow powder, so while Tom swirled the ingredients together, I got a length of brass pipe sealed at one end from the workshop in the back. I used a nail to widen a hole near the sealed end. Into that, I slipped a loop of woven, ash-colored cord.<br> <br>Tom raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;Master Benedict keeps cannon fuse?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We use it to light things from far away,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Tom said, &#x201c;things you have to light from far away probably shouldn&#x2019;t be lit at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>The mixture we ended up with looked harmless, just a fine black powder. Tom poured it into the open end while I propped up the pipe. A narrow stream spilled over the side, scattering charcoal grains onto the floor. I stamped the powder in the tube down with cotton wadding.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are we going to use for a cannonball?&#x201d; Tom said.<br> <br>Master Benedict didn&#x2019;t keep anything in the store that would fit snugly in the pipe. The best I could come up with was a handful of lead shot we used for shavings to put in our remedies. They scraped down the brass and landed with a hollow thump on the cotton at the bottom.<br> <br>Now we needed a target, and soon. It had taken a lot longer to put everything together than I thought it would, and though I&#x2019;d assured Tom that my master wouldn&#x2019;t return, his comings and goings weren&#x2019;t exactly predictable.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not firing this thing outside,&#x201d; Tom said.<br> <br>He was right about that. The neighbors would not look kindly on lead shot flying through their parlors. And as tempting a target as the stuffed beaver on the mantel was, Master Benedict was even less likely to appreciate us going to war with the animals that decorated his shop.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about that?&#x201d; I said. Hanging from the ceiling near the fireplace was a small iron cauldron. &#x201c;We can shoot at the bottom of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom pushed aside the antimony cups on the other table, leaving enough space to put down the cauldron. I picked up our cannon and pressed it against my abdomen to hold it steady. Tom tore a scrap of parchment from our deciphered recipe and held it in the fire until it caught. Then he lit the cannon&#x2019;s wick. Sparks fizzed, racing toward the pipe like a flaming hornet. Tom dived behind the counter and peeked over the top.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch this,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>The blast nearly blew my ears off. I saw a burst of flame, and a mound of smoke, then the pipe kicked back like an angry ox and nailed me right between the legs.</p><h2>True Wealth: How and Why Millions of Americans Are Creating a Time-Rich, Ecologically Light, Small-Scale, High-Satisfaction Economy</h2><p><b>A groundbreaking statement about ecological decline, suggesting a radical change in how we think about consumer goods, value, and ways to live. </b><p>In <i>True Wealth</i> , economist Juliet B. Schor rejects the sacrifice message, with the insight that social innovations and new technology can simultaneously enhance our lives and protect the planet. Schor shares examples of urban farmers, DIY renovators, and others working outside the conventional market to illuminate the path away from the work-and-spend cycle and toward a new world rich in time, creativity, information, and community.</p></p><p><b> Juliet B. Schor</b> is a bestselling author, professor of sociology at Boston College, and cofounder of A New American Dream, an organization devoted to transforming North American lifestyles to make them more ecologically and socially sustainable. She lives in Newton, Massachusetts.Schor (<i>Born to Buy</i>) introduces her concept of plenitude as a way forward after the recent shattering of global capitalism and continued rise in CO2 emissions. Plentitude is a commitment to enjoying&#x2014;not exploiting&#x2014;nature's richness, to envisioning environmental, economic, and psychological health as braided and capable of growing symbiotically and more securely than the business as usual practices that imploded in 2008. Schor pleads for avoiding planetary ecocide: even though the polar ice caps are shrinking and 38% of the 45,000 species studied by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature are under threat of extinction, the West&#x2014;particularly Americans&#x2014;continue to create waste and gobble up resources at unsustainable rates (in 2006, the U.S. emission of CO2 was 19.7 metric tons per capita, compared to 1.3 in India). Fortunately, the interest in alternative energy, recycling, and clean nanotechnologies is increasing, and Schor encourages readers to match it by breaking out of a work hard/spend hard cycle, thereby improving both the environment and quality of life. It might be utopian, but it's also fresh, persuasive, and passionately argued, speaking to the individual and the collective. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lucas reveals the asymmetrical relationship between Russia and the West, a result of the fact that Russia is prepared to use armed force whenever necessary, while the West is not.

The New Cold War is about the fate that has yet again befallen the unfortunate region of Europe that lies on the borderlands of East and West.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daniel Johnson, New York Sun</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The New Cold War</i> powerfully argues that America and Europe's excessive focus on Iraq and Afghanistan has blinded them to a threat closer to home. Thoroughly informed, steeped in his subject's recent history, with a flinty, caustic style that usually sizes up political phenomena with exacting precision, Lucas reminds us why longtime foreign correspondents surpass rookies who parachute into a foreign hotspot....Lucas offers one of the best briefs on how Yeltsin's Wild West became Putin's chilly petrofascism, detailing the return of rigged elections, forced psychiatric medication, the use of natural resources as foreign-policy bludgeons, and the rogue nations that are once again Moscow's best friends.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Edward Lucas is one of the best-informed, best-connected, and most perceptive journalists writing about Putin's Russia. The New Cold War is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand what is happening in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union today.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Anne Applebaum, author of Gulag, A History</i></p><p>&#x201c;Edward Lucas's absorbing book shows the forces that are turning Russia against the West. They include militarism, greed, and a failure to understand that national greatness can be based only on civilized values. It is an invaluable primer for students of the Russian situation and a cautionary tale for those who prefer to treat Russia as it pretends to be rather than as it is.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Satter, author of Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State</i></p><p>&#x201c;While the West is preoccupied with the Middle East and Islamic terrorism, Edward Lucas warns, Russia is quietly reinventing herself as a milder version of the Soviet Union and hence as a new threat to the West. Conceding Putin's domestic achievements, the seasoned East European correspondent of The Economist tracks post-Communist Russia's skillful exploitation of the capitalist world's greed to divide and thus to dominate it. It is a chilling account that needs to be taken seriously.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richard Pipes, author of The Russian Revolution</i></p><p>&#x201c;Veteran Moscow news correspondent Edward Lucas provides an authoritative analysis of the disturbing events in Russia today in this thoughtful, thoroughly researched and brilliantly written book that deserves the widest possible readership.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert Gellately, author of Lenin, Stalin and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Edward Lucas offers a devastating but apt critique of Vladimir Putin's domestic repression and increasingly aggressive foreign policy. This stark and clear-sighted book is an excellent read. It makes evident the need for a new Western policy. Russia's political development is one of the key issues of our time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Anders �slund, senior fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Edward Lucas has written a brilliant and profoundly disturbing study of modern Russia. It is the history of rediscovered authoritarianism and the stunning brutality with which the KGB elite returned to power. It is also the story of how Western venality and political credulity made this possible and placed the security of Europe at risk. Above all, this is the tale of how President Putin methodically destroyed the vestiges of democracy in Russia and launched a New Cold War against the West. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Edward Lucas's latest work for US and European policymakers.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bruce P.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. When it was first published, this was the first work on the subject from the medieval Arab world that had been made available in English. The original manuscript which formed the basis for this translation is contemporary with Ascham&#39;s &#34;Toxophilus&#34;, which is considered the only source of detailed knowledge of English archery. The Arabic manuscript is thorough and authoritative, evidently the work of an expert bowman. A vast amount of information concerning the long-range artillery, by which one eastern empire after another had been won, is here brought forward into full light after having laid hidden for centuries. It can still serve as a textbook on archery to this day.</p><p></p><h2>A Commentary on Judges and Ruth (Kregel Exegetical Library)</h2><p>This definitive commentary sheds exegetical and theological light on the books of Judges and Ruth for contemporary preachers and students of Scripture. Listening closely to the text while interacting with the best of scholarship, Chisholm shows what the text mean for ancient Israel and what it means for us today. In addition to its perceptive comments on the biblical text, it examines a host of themes such as covenants and the sovereignty of God in Judges and providence, redemption, loving-kindness, and Christological typology in Ruth. Chisholm offers astute guidance to preachers and teachers wanting to do a series on Judges or Ruth by providing &#34;homiletical trajectories&#34; after each exegetical unit. These show how historical narrative can be presented in the pulpit and classroom, for rich, responsible sermons and lessons.</p><p><p>Robert B.

This underground classic, the first real quality guide to brain tanning -- tens of thousands of copies sold -- is now being published and made widely available for the first time. 'Blue Mountain Buckskin' is a complete how-to guide to tanning buckskin at home, using the methods Native Americans and outdoorsmen have preferred for thousands of years. It also includes 40 pages on creating garments, pouches, moccasins and other traditional uses of the deer.</p></p><p><p><b>Jim Riggs</b> is a nationally reknowned teacher of tanning and other outdoor skills and has been for over 40 years. He has done a great deal of work for museums, tribes and the US government. He was also the skills advisor for the Clan of the Cave Bear books and movies. A trained archaelogist himself, he has spent most of his adult life teaching archaeologists, professors, movie directors, survivalists and anyone else how to tan hides, flintknap, craft a bow, make a basket, build a shelter, start a fire by friction and find wild foods. In the 80's and 90's, before survival tv shows; if you wanted to learn these skills, you had to seek out Jim --- which wasn't always easy --- and learn from this incredibly knowledgable, humble, and well-written man. Many of today's experts on a wide variety of outdoor skills got their start learning from Jim. He continues to wear buckskin and reside in a cabin in the mountains of eastern Oregon.</p><p>Jim Riggs originally wrote this book in 1979, on a typewriter, and published it himself. And although he never sold it through the traditional book trade, he sold tens of thousands of copies. Why? Because it was the first book to really teach people in a detailed step-by-step manner, how to 'brain tan': the method used by Native Americans and American pioneers to make garment leather, and still the most practical way for you to successfully make really good leather in your own backyard.<br><br>Riggs made and wore his own buckskin daily for years before writing this book, so his instructions are both expert and very detailed about the nuances (and odd situations) that this craft can entail. His love of buckskin, sense of humor, and respect for the animals whose skins he is tanning shine through the pages.<br><br>You'll learn step-by-step through words, illustrations and photographs; how to skin, tan, and then make clothing from the hides of deer, elk or antelope. You'll learn the 'dry-scrape' method of brain tanning (there is also a wetscrape method), and you'll have a great time doing it!</p></p><h2>The Catholic Prayer Bible: Lectio Divina Edition (NRSV)</h2><p>An ideal Bible for anyone who desires to reflect on the individual stories and chapters of just one, or even all, of the biblical books, while being led to prayer though meditation on that biblical passage.</p><p></p><h2>The Whispers</h2><p><b><b>A middle grade debut that's a heartrending coming-of-age tale, perfect for fans of </b><b><i>Bridge to Terabithia</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Counting By 7s</i></b><b>.</b></b><br><br>Eleven-year-old Riley believes in the whispers, magical fairies that will grant you wishes if you leave them tributes.

The voices came to him so gently he thought it might be the wind, or the first trickle of summer rain. But as time passed, the voices grew louder and the boy was sure they were calling his name. So he followed them.<br><br> The Whispers led the boy to a clearing deep in the woods where a rotted old tree stump sat in the center and fallen leaves covered the ground like crunchy brown carpet. The boy stood next to the stump, waited, and listened. He couldn&#x2019;t see the Whispers, but he knew they were there. Their wispy voices surrounded him, tickling the rims of his ears and filling every darkened shadow of the forest.<br><br> After waiting patiently for quite some time, the Whispers&#x2019; garbled words finally began to make sense to the boy, and they told him things. The Whispers knew everything&#x2014;all the secrets of the universe. They told the boy what color the moon was up close and how many miles of ocean covered the Earth. They even told him how long he would live&#x2014;26,332 days. The boy was pleased, because that sounded like a good long time to him. But as they continued to whisper knowledge into his ear, they never showed themselves to the boy. He only caught glimpses from the corner of his eye of their faint bluish glow fading in and out around him. He so badly wanted to see them, to know what kind of creatures they were. How big were they? Or how tiny? Were they thin, or fat, or hairy? Were they made of skin and bones like him, or of tree bark, or leaves, or dirt? Or something else entirely?<br><br>The Whispers told the boy that if he brought them tributes, they would give him his heart&#x2019;s desires. The boy wasn&#x2019;t sure what a tribute was and he didn&#x2019;t want very much anyway. He could hardly call them heart&#x2019;s desires. Maybe a new pair of sneakers so the kids at school wouldn&#x2019;t tease him about his raggedy old ones. Maybe a better job for his father so he wouldn&#x2019;t worry so much about money. And he would love to see his mother smile again, something she rarely did anymore. But he guessed what he really wanted was to see the Whispers with his very own eyes.<br><br>One day, as the boy&#x2019;s mother made a batch of her special blackberry jam, he asked her what a tribute was. She thought about it a moment and finally told him that a tribute was like a gift to show respect. The boy eyed his mother&#x2019;s handiwork spread over the kitchen table. Everyone loved her jam. When she took it to the local farmers market, she always sold out. And her blackberry jam was his personal favorite. He was sure it would make an excellent tribute for the Whispers. When his mother left the room, the boy took one of the jars from the table and hid it under his bed.<br><br>The following afternoon, as the sun was setting, he went back to the clearing in the woods with the jam tucked under his arm. He left it sitting on the rotted old tree stump for the Whispers. Satisfied with his tribute, the boy spoke his heart&#x2019;s desires aloud and then hurried home as not to scare the Whispers away.<br><br>When the boy&#x2019;s father got home from work that evening, his mood was lighter than usual and the lines of worry had completely vanished from his face. He told the family that he&#x2019;d received a promotion at work and tomorrow the boy&#x2019;s mother should take him shopping to buy him new clothes and shoes for school. This news made his mother smile. The boy was amazed that he&#x2019;d received three of his heart&#x2019;s desires with only one jar of jam. Surely the Whispers would reveal themselves to him if he took them a tribute even better than a jar of his mother&#x2019;s blackberry jam. And he knew just the thing.<br><br>The next day, when the boy returned from shopping with his mother, he snuck out of the house right before sunset and took his new sneakers to the clearing in the woods. He kept them in the box, neatly wrapped in tissue paper so they wouldn&#x2019;t get scuffed or dirty. They were the nicest shoes he&#x2019;d ever owned, and surely this tribute would persuade the Whispers to show themselves.<br><br>When he approached the rotted old tree stump, he saw that the blackberry jam was gone. The boy wasn&#x2019;t surprised. He was sure the Whispers enjoyed his mother&#x2019;s jam just as much as everyone else did. He put the box with his sneakers on top of the rotted old tree stump, stood back, and waited. And waited. And waited. He waited so long, he wasn&#x2019;t sure the Whispers were pleased enough with his tribute.<br><br>Finally something tickled the back of his neck with the lightest flutter of breath grazing his skin. It spoke his name and asked him what he wished. The boy froze. The Whispers had never come that close before. They must be pleased with his tribute after all. He was excited, but afraid if he moved it would scare them away, so he closed his eyes and remained perfectly still.<br><br>&#x201c;I wish to see you,&#x201d; the boy said in barely a whisper of his own. &#x201c;I want to know what you look like. It&#x2019;s my heart&#x2019;s desire.&#x201d;<br><br>At first there was no clear answer, only a garble of Whispers conversation that he couldn&#x2019;t understand. Then the words slowly pieced themselves together like a puzzle in his ear.<br><br>&#x201c;If we reveal ourselves, you can never leave us,&#x201d; the Whispers said, their velvety voices caressing his ear through the warm summer breeze. &#x201c;You must stay here in the woods with us forever, for you will know everything, and that is a burden too great to bear in your world.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy swallowed hard. He closed his eyes even tighter and stood very still as sweat trailed down his neck, the Whispers&#x2019; words chilling him from head to toe.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure this is what you wish?&#x201d; the Whispers asked. &#x201c;To see us? To stay with us and become a whisper in the wind?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy began to worry. He thought about all the things he would miss if he stayed in the woods with the Whispers forever. He would never get to ride his bike again, or go swimming in the pond with his friends. And he would never see his mother and father again. It seemed like an awfully high price to pay just to see what the Whispers looked like. Besides, he&#x2019;d already offered them his brand-new sneakers, and they were the nicest things he owned. Wasn&#x2019;t that enough?<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the Whispers said, reading his thoughts. &#x201c;It is not enough. If you see us, you must become one of us. And then you will know everything there is to know. You will hear everything. See everything. But the only tribute we can accept for that is your soul.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy stood there with his eyes closed tight, scared he might accidentally see one of the Whispers and then the choice would be made for him. He needed a moment to think. The boy wondered what else there was to know. Because of the Whispers he knew the color of the moon up close, how many miles of ocean covered the Earth, and how long he would live&#x2014;26,332 days. He knew he had a home to which he could return. He knew his parents loved him and his father worked hard to take care of their family. And the kids at school would tease him a little less now that he had brand-new sneakers.<br><br>The boy knew it would be dark soon and if he waited too long he might never find his way out of the woods. Then what would the Whispers do with him? He felt around until he found the box with his sneakers on the tree stump. He grabbed it, turned, and ran as fast as he could. He held the box close to his chest and didn&#x2019;t dare open his eyes. He tripped and fell. Got back up and ran into one tree after another. Branches whacked him across the face and chest, but he kept running blindly through the woods.<br><br>Only after he&#x2019;d gone a good long ways and the tiny voices had faded behind him did the boy dare open his eyes. Even then he was careful not to look around. He stared straight ahead until he got to the tree line and ran the whole way home, never looking back, not even when he reached his house.<br><br>After that the boy never heard the Whispers again, but he didn&#x2019;t mind. He already had his heart&#x2019;s desires. He had his mother. And his father. And his friends. And his brand-new sneakers. Plus he knew what color the moon was up close, how many miles of ocean covered the Earth, and how long he would live&#x2014;26,332 days. He didn&#x2019;t know all the secrets of the universe and maybe he never would, but he knew plenty.<br> <i><br>This was Mama&#x2019;s favorite story.

The Vienna of the early twentieth century was not marketed in this way. In those days it was not marketed at all. Maria Hornor Lansdale's once-indispensable guide of 1902 draws a portrait of the Hapsburg capital that is at once grubbier and more dynamic than anything suggested in our modern guidebooks. Her book describes parts of the Innere Stadt or city center as "dark, dirty and gloomy" and of the Jewish quarter she wrote: "The interiors of the houses are unspeakably squalid. As one ascends the stair the rickety banister sticks to one's fingers, and the walls on either side ooze. Entering a small dark room the ceiling is covered with soot and the furniture crowded close together."<br>&nbsp;<br>A German might step onto a Viennese streetcar and find himself unable to exchange a word with any of his fellow passengers, for the city then was home to a rapidly expanding population of Magyars, Rumanians, Italians, Poles, Serbs, Czechs, Slovenes, Slovaks, Croats, Ruthenians, Dalmatians, Istrians and Bosnians, all of whom lived together apparently in happiness. An American diplomat describing the city in 1898 wrote:<br><br><i>A man who had been but a short time in Vienna, may himself be of pure&nbsp;German stock, but his wife will be Galician or Polish, his cook Bohemian, his children's nurse Dalmatian, his man a Servian, his coachman a Slav, his barber a Magyar, and his son's tutor a Frenchman. A majority of the administration's employees are Zechs, and the Hungarians have most influence in the affairs of the government. No, Vienna is </i>not<i> a German city!<br></i><br>The Viennese were regarded abroad as a good-natured, easygoing, and highly cultured people. By day the middle class congregated in cafes, spending hours in conversation over a single cup of coffee and a glass of water. Here newspapers and magazines were provided in all languages. In the evenings they dressed for dancing, for the opera, the theater or the concert hall. They were fanatical about these entertainments, unforgiving of the poor player who forgot his lines or the singer who sang sharp, while idolizing or deifying their favorites. The Viennese writer Stefan Zweig remembered that passion from his youth: "Whereas in politics, in administration, or in morals, everything went on rather comfortably and one was affably tolerant of all that was slovenly and overlooked many an infringement, in artistic matters there was no pardon; here the honour of the city was at stake."<br><br>***<br><br>On December 1, 1913, there was cold sunshine over most of Austria. By the evening a mist had spread from the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains down to the rolling hills and verdant lowlands of the Alpine Foreland. In Vienna, the air was still, the streets and pavements quiet and the temperature uncommonly cold. For the twenty-six-year-old Paul Wittgenstein this was a day of high excitement and excruciating tension.<br><br>Clammy fingers and cold hands figure in every pianist's worst dream--the slightest sheen from the glands of the pads can cause the fingers to slip or "glitch," accidentally hitting two adjacent keys at once. The sweaty-fingered pianist is slave to his caution. If his hands are too cold, the finger muscles will stiffen. Coldness in the bones does not drive sweat from the skin and in the worst instances the fingers may be immobilized by cold while remaining slippery with sweat. Many concert artists spend a nervous hour or two before a winter recital with their hands plunged into a basin of hot water.<br><br>Paul's concert debut was scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. in the Grosser Musikvereinsaal, a hallowed place, of near perfect acoustic, where Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler heard many of their works performed for the first time. It is from here--the "Golden Hall"--that the famous New Year orgy of waltzes and polkas is annually broadcast to the world. Paul did not expect his debut to sell out. The auditorium had a seating capacity of 1,654, with 300 standing places. It was a Monday night, he was unknown, and the program he had chosen to perform was unfamiliar to the Viennese public. He was, however, well acquainted with techniques for papering a house. As a boy he had been sent by his mother to buy 200 tickets for a concert in which a family friend was playing the violin. The man at the ticket office dismissed him as a tout, shouting in his face: "If it's tickets for resale you're wanting you can go elsewhere!" Paul returned to his mother, begging her to appoint someone else to the task. For the first time in his life he felt ashamed of being rich.<br><br>If the hall was going to be half empty, at least those seats that were occupied should be filled with as many allies as possible. He wanted to create an atmosphere that would give the impression of strong public support. The Wittgenstein family was large and well connected. All siblings, cousins, uncles and aunts were expected to attend and to applaud uproariously at the end of each piece regardless of how they felt he had played. Tenants, servants and the servants' distant relations, many of whom had never before attended a concert of serious music, were plied with tickets and summoned to appear. Paul could have hired a smaller hall but was advised that the critics might not show up if he did so. He needed Max Kalbeck of the Neues Wiener Tagblatt and Julius Korngold of the Neue Freie Presse to be there. These were the two most influential music critics in Vienna.<br><br>Every detail was carefully considered. A concert with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra would have cost him nearly twice as much as the less prestigious Tonkunstler Orchestra, but money was no object. "Quite apart from the price," he later wrote, "I would not hire the Vienna Philharmonic. Probably they won't play as you want them to do, it will look like a horse which you can't ride; and then if the concert is a success, people might say it was only due to the orchestra's merit." He chose the Tonkunstler.<br><br>The conductor, Oskar Nedbal, was twelve years older than Paul, an ex-pupil of Dvorak, a composer and a first-class violist who had joined the Tonkunstler Orchestra in 1906 after ten years as conductor of the Czech Philharmonic. On Christmas Eve 1930, he threw himself head first from a fourth-story window of a hotel in Zagreb and was heard of no more.<br><br>Paul's program was unusual, obstinate and provocative. He wanted to present four consecutive works for piano and orchestra--four virtuosic concertos in a single evening. Irrespective of success or failure, this young man's debut would long be remembered as an audacious gymnastic spectacle. <br><br>Works by the inebriate Irish composer John Field, who had died in Moscow of cancer of the rectum in 1837, had long fallen from fashion in Vienna. Nowadays "Drunken John" is best remembered as the man who invented the nocturne--a form of short piano reverie later popularized by Chopin. Paul's valet and cook were probably not the only ones in the audience that night never to have heard of him. Even among the musical cognoscenti of 1913, few would have rated Field as worthy of the Golden Hall, for Vienna had a musical heritage of its own, the most illustrious of any city in the world, and to those raised on a diet of Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler (all of whom had lived at one time or another within the city walls), Field's music would have seemed at best an insipid curiosity, at worst a bad-taste joke.<br><br>History does not record how Paul felt in the hours leading up to the concert or his state of mind as he dressed in his tails, warmed his hands in the green room, climbed the steep steps onto the concert platform and took his bows before an audience of friends, strangers, critics, mentors, teachers and servants, but he never succeeded in controlling his nerves. Later he was observed to bash the walls with his fists, tear up his music or hurl furniture across the room in the fraught final minutes before walking onto the stage.<br><br>The Field Concerto is in three movements lasting a total of thirty-five minutes. If Paul failed to notice at the time, he must have been informed afterward that Julius Korngold, chief critic of the Neue Freie Presse, had left the auditorium during the applause and had not returned to hear his renditions of Mendelssohn's Serenade and Allegro giocoso, the Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Czerny by Josef Labor, or Liszt's crashing bravura Concerto in E flat. As he and his family scoured the papers and music journals in the days following the concert, this critic's curious behavior must have weighed heavily on their minds.<br><br>Ludwig, Paul's younger brother, was not in Vienna to hear him play. Three months earlier he had moved from England (where he had been studying philosophy at Cambridge) into two rooms of a postmaster's house in a tiny village at the bottom of a fjord, north of Bergen in Norway. According to the diaries of his closest friend, his decision to exile himself was "wild and sudden." In September he had stated that he wished to withdraw from a world in which "he perpetually finds himself feeling contempt for others and irritating others by his nervous temperament." He was also at this time suffering (as he often did) from delusions of his own death. "The feeling that I shall have to die before being able to publish my ideas is growing stronger and stronger in me every day," he wrote to his tutor and mentor at Cambridge. A fortnight later a shock spurred him on his course of action--it took the form of a letter announcing that his sister Gretl and her husband Jerome were coming to live in London. "He can't stand either of them and he won't live in England liable always to visits from them," his friend recorded. "I am leaving at once," Ludwig exclaimed, "because my brother-in-law has come to live in London and I can't bear to be so near him."<br><br>The whole family wanted Ludwig to come to Vienna for Paul's concert and for Christmas, but he was resistant and the obligation to conform weighed heavily upon him. His family depressed him, the previous Christmas had been horrific, he was in low spirits and his philosophical work was advancing at a snail's pace. "UNFORTUNATELY I have to go to Vienna for Christmas," he wrote to a friend. "The fact is my mother very much wants me to, so much so that she would be grievously offended if I refused. She has such dreadful memories of just this time last year that I do not have the heart to stay away."<br><br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THAT TIME LAST YEAR<br><br>Christmas at the Wittgensteins' Winter Palais on the Alleegasse in Vienna's Wieden district was, by tradition, an extravagant and ceremonious affair to which the family attached the greatest significance; but the Christmas of 1912 (the year before Paul's concert debut) was different from all the rest, for on that occasion the family's energies and enthusiasms were subdued by the grim realization that its head (Paul and Ludwig's father Karl Wittgenstein)--stout-chested and leathery of complexion--was dying in his bedroom upstairs. He was suffering from cancer of the tongue and a month earlier had submitted himself to the scalpels of the distinguished Viennese surgeon Baron Anton von Eiselsberg. To gain access to the lesion Dr. von Eiselsberg had needed first to remove a large section of Karl's lower jaw. Only then was he able to proceed with the extirpation of the neck glands, the floor of the mouth and whatever was left of Karl's tongue after previous surgical raids. His bleeding was staunched by a team of assistants using the modern technique of electrical cautery.<br><br>Karl had smoked large Cuban cigars all his adult life and continued to use them even after the first symptoms of his disease had been diagnosed seven years earlier. Then he was advised by doctors not to move in order to effect a cure. By the end, he had endured seven operations, but the cancer continued to outmaneuver every stratagem that Dr. von Eiselsberg could devise against it, shifting in a sequence of malignant sideways steps from thyroid to ear to throat and eventually to his tongue. His final operation took place on November 8, 1912. Eiselsberg had warned him that there was a risk of his dying under the knife and on the evening before, as the doctors were sharpening their tools, Karl and his wife Leopoldine retired to the opulent gloom of the Musiksaal. He took out his violin, she sat at the piano, and together they played through some of their favorite works by Bach, Beethoven and Brahms in a long, unspoken farewell to one another.<br><br>The next morning, in the center of his plain, well-lit, clean-tiled theater, Dr. von Eiselsberg cut the tumor from Karl's mouth. Perhaps this time he had finally succeeded in eradicating the last traces of the cancer, but for Karl--flat, speechless and entrapped by the curse of a secondary infection--it was already too late. He left the clinic to die at home. And thus it was that on Christmas Day 1912, as he lay outstretched, weakened and feverish upon his bed, his family was gathered round in a mood of grim expectation.<br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KARL'S GREAT REBELLION<br><br>Hermine (pronounced Hermeena), nicknamed Mining, was the firstborn of Karl's nine children and his favorite child. Named after her grandfather, Hermann Wittgenstein, her birth marked a turning point in Karl's business fortunes and as a consequence he always treated her as a lucky mascot. She was thirty-nine years old at the time of his dying, unmarried, still living at home and still at his beck and call. In character she was inward looking, a repressed person, whose movements were stiff, whose stance was erect and whose manner (to those who did not know her well) appeared to be arrogant or aloof. In fact she suffered from low self-esteem and was ill at ease in the company of strangers. When Brahms came to dinner and she was allowed to sit with him at the top table, she became so agitated with nervous tension that she had to leave the room and spend most of the evening vomiting into one of the Palais lavatories. Photographs of the youthful Hermine portray her as alert, feminine, perhaps even pretty, but an instinctive need for privacy put her always on her guard against the approaches of men. They say she had one or two suitors in her prime but none so ardent as to relieve her of her maidenhood.<br><br>As the years piled on she withdrew from all but her closest circle of friends and family, her smile shortened and she grew self-conscious, gracious, vigilant and schoolmarmish. On the hottest days, she dressed in the heaviest and most somber clothes, brushing her hair flat back against her head and pressing her ponytail into a tight coil at the nape of her neck. Her ears were broad and heavy and her nose uncommonly prominent--both features inherited from her father. In her last years she resembled a handsome army officer in the first gloat of early retirement, a bit like Captain von Trapp in the film version of <i>The Sound of Music.<br></i></p><h2>Love &amp; War In The Apennines</h2><p>Love and War in the Apennines</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesEric Newby was born in London in 1919.

Many believe it had to do with a treasure he had dug up. And only Pickles, his dog, knows what happened. Meanwhile, Miss Potter faces dilemmas in her love life and with her parents. But she has no time to muse, what with helping humans and animals alike?and this little matter of murder.</p><p><b>Susan Wittig Albert</b> grew up on a farm in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley. A former professor of English and a university administrator and vice president, she is the author of the China Bayles Mysteries, the Darling Dahlias Mysteries, and the Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter. Some of her recent titles include<i> Widow&#x2019;s Tears</i>,<i> Cat&#x2019;s Claw</i>,<i> The Darling Dahlias and the Confederate Rose</i>, and <i>The Tale of Castle Cottage</i>. She and her husband, Bill, coauthor a series of Victorian-Edwardian mysteries under the name Robin Paige, which includes such titles as <i>Death at Glamis Castle </i>and <i>Death at Whitechapel</i>.*Starred Review* This whimsical, amiable, enchanting, gentle, and charming tale is the fifth (and best) in Sharon Wittig Albert&#x2019;s series featuring Miss Beatrix Potter. It succeeds on many levels and for many audiences. Readers should not expect a traditional mystery as there is no murder; instead, there is a series of intrigues to be untangled by the tactful Miss Potter. The puzzles include the death of the antiquarian Hugh Wickstead (killed by a falling treetop), a fireball burning down a barn, the mysterious appearance of a long-lost sister of Mr. Wickstead, and a missing treasure. This is also a fantasy, with talking animals and dragons who seem to know more about the puzzles than any of the humans. In true old-fashioned style, the narrator is omniscient and regularly tells the reader information to which the book&#x2019;s characters are not privy. This technique was used by Potter herself in her little tales and by Baum in the Oz books. There is also a real-life romance beginning to flourish between the two &#x201c;real&#x201d; characters, Beatrix Potter and her solicitor, Will Heelis. On yet another level, this is an engaging historical novel imparting much information about the life of Beatrix Potter in December 1909 in the village of Near Sawrey in the Lake District of England. Readers who begin with the open mind of a child will be well rewarded. --Judy Coon</p><h2>Sharing a Laugh: Heartwarming and Sidesplitting Stories from Patsy Clairmont, Barbara Johnson, Nicole Johnson, Marilyn Meberg, Luci Swindoll, Sheila Walsh, and Thelma Wells</h2><p><p>Laughter is the best medicine, and the Women of Faith� speakers definitely know how to lose themselves in laughter.

In a world ruled by petty tyrants and constantly at war, the young Dracula better known as Vlad the Impaler - was held hostage by the Turks while his father was assassinated and his brother was buried alive. Finally released, Dracula conducted an almighty purge, surrounding his palace with noblemen impaled on stakes. Then he turned his attention to military campaigns against the Turks and Bulgars to consolidate his power.Yet to Romanians and the Pope he was a hero and liberator, fighting to protect his kingdom and countrymen from invasion in a complex and treacherous time. And, as an initiate in the Order of the Dragon, Dracula also played a vital (if not entirely noble) part in the fight against the Ottoman war machine.Here, James Waterson details the good and the bad of this warlord prince, offering a fascinating insight into the violent end of the Middle Ages.</p><p></p><h2>Alive Still: Nell Blaine, American Painter</h2><p>Among the women artists who came to prominence in the postwar era in New York, painter Nell Blaine had a uniquely hard-won career. In her mid-thirties, her horizons seemed limitless. Her shows received glowing reviews, <em>ARTnews</em> honored her with a lengthy feature article, and one of her paintings hung in the Whitney Museum. Then, on a trip to Greece, Blaine developed polio, rendering her a paraplegic. Angry at being told she would never paint again, she taught herself to hold a brush with her left hand and regained her skill. In <em>Alive Still</em>, author Cathy Curtis tells the story of Blaine's life and career for the first time by investigating the ways her experience of illness colored her personality and the evolving nature of her work, the importance of her Southern roots, and the influence of her bisexuality (and, in the latter part of her life, long term lesbian relationships) on her understanding of the world. <br><br><em>Alive Still</em> draws upon Blaine's unpublished diaries; her published writing; career-spanning interviews and reviews; and correspondence to and from family members, lovers, and the artists, poets, publishers, rescuers in Greece, and neighbors she knew. In addition, Curtis has conducted interviews with surviving artists and other individuals in Blaine's circle, including two of her longtime lovers. <br><br>Featuring illustrations of Blaine's work and snapshots of family and friends, <em>Alive Still </em>is a compelling narrative of a leading, productive, and passionate woman artist who overcame the setbacks of disability.<br></p><p><br><strong>Cathy Curtis</strong> is the author of two previous biographies, <em>Restless Ambition: Grace Hartigan, Painter</em>, and <em>A Generous Vision: The Creative Life of Elaine de Kooning</em>.

In 2018, Curtis was elected to a two-year term as president of Biographers International Organization (BIO).<br><br>"In her third vivid, defining biography of an underappreciated American woman artist, following portraits of Grace Hartigan and Elaine de Kooning, Curtis Illuminates the zestful spirit of a painter who contended with extreme adversity...

The standard accounts of Sunni political history typically end with the classical period and thereby leave out Ibn Taymiyya&#39;s contribution. This original study demonstrates how his influence shed new light on the entire trajectory of Islamic political thought. Although he did not reject the Caliphate ideal, as is commonly believed, he nevertheless radically redefined it by turning it into a rational political institution intended to serve the community (umma). Through creative reinterpretation, he deployed the Qur&#39;anic concept of fitra (divinely endowed human nature) to center the community of believers and its common-sense reading of revelation as the highest epistemic authority. In this way, he subverted the elitism that had become ensconced in classical theological, legal, and spiritual doctrines, and tried to revive the ethico-political, rather than strictly legal, dimension of Islam. In its reassessment of Ibn Taymiyya&#39;s work, this book marks a major departure from traditional interpretations of medieval Islamic thought.</p><p>In a revisionist account of the history of Islamic political thought from the early to the late medieval period, this book focuses on the thought of Ibn Taymiyya, one of the most brilliant theologians of his day.

The one who is speaking is inevitably revealed by the singular sound of her voice, no matter "what" she says. We take this fact for granted&#x2015;for example, every time someone asks, over the telephone, "Who is speaking?" and receives as a reply the familiar utterance, "It's me." Starting from the given uniqueness of every voice, Cavarero rereads the history of philosophy through its peculiar evasion of this embodied uniqueness. She shows how this history&#x2015;along with the fields it comprehends, such as linguistics, musicology, political theory, and studies in orality&#x2015;might be grasped as the "devocalization of Logos," as the invariable privileging of <i>semantike</i> over <i>phone</i>, mind over body. Female figures&#x2015;from the Sirens to the Muses, from Echo to opera singers&#x2015;provide a crucial counterhistory, one in which the embodied voice triumphs over the immaterial semantic. Reconstructing this counterhistory, Cavarero proposes a "politics of the voice" wherein the ancient bond between Logos and politics is reconfigured, and wherein what matters is not the communicative content of a given discourse, but rather <i>who</i> is speaking.</p><p>Adriana Cavarero is Professor of Political Philosophy at the University of Verona, Italy, and Visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and New York University. Italy's most renowned feminist philosopher, she is the author of numerous essays and books, including (in English) <i>In Spite of Plato</i> (1995), <i>Relating Narratives: Storytelling and Selfhood</i> (2000), and <i>Stately Bodies</i> (2002)."Cavarero is lyrical, commanding, sweeping."

Strauss offers an insightful and instructive reading through description and analysis of each book of the dialogue.<b>Leo Strauss</b> (1899&#x2013;1973) was one of the preeminent political philosophers of the twentieth century. From 1949 to 1968 he was professor of political science at the University of Chicago. He is the author of many books, among them <i>The Political Philosophy of Hobbes, Natural Right and History,</i> and <i>Spinoza&#x2019;s Critique of Religion,</i> all published by the University of Chicago Press.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Theoretical Hydrodynamics (Dover Books on Physics)</h2><p><p>This classic text offers a thorough, clear and methodical introductory exposition of the mathematical theory of fluid motion, useful in applications to both hydrodynamics and aerodynamics. Departing radically from traditional approaches, the author bases the treatment on vector methods and notation with their natural consequence in two dimensions &#x2014; the complex variable.<br>New features in this edition include: a chapter bringing together various exact treatments of two-dimensional motion with a free surface in a gravitational field, followed by one dealing with approximations (mostly linearized) relevant to this but with emphasis on waves; a chapter on tensor methods applied to the flow of viscous fluids; a chapter on flow with small Reynolds' number, including an account of a novel application of the complex variable to Stokes' flow; and an outline of the theory of two-dimensional laminar flow in a boundary layer.<br>Prerequisites are restricted to a knowledge of elementary calculus since any additional mathematics is introduced as required, making this a self-contained treatment. Nearly 400 diagrams help illustrate the text and over 600 exercises are collected into sets of examples at the end of each chapter.</p><p></p></p><p>Applied mathematician Louis Melville Milne-Thomson (1891-1974) taught for several decades at the Royal British Naval Academy in Greenwich. In his retirement he served as a visiting professor at research facilities around the world.</p><h2>The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Basis and Its Genesis (Phoenix Books)</h2><p><p>In this classic analysis, Leo Strauss pinpoints what is original and innovative in the political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes. He argues that Hobbes's ideas arose not from tradition or science but from his own deep knowledge and experience of human nature. Tracing the development of Hobbes's moral doctrine from his early writings to his major work <i>The Leviathan,</i> Strauss explains contradictions in the body of Hobbes's work and discovers startling connections between Hobbes and the thought of Plato, Thucydides, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Hegel.</p></p><p><b>Leo Strauss</b> (1899-1973) was Robert Maynard Hutchins Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in political science at the University of Chicago.

As the commercial and residential infrastructure of the city decayed, people and jobs migrated to the suburbs. Urban renewal was supposed to make the downtown viable again as a site for both businesses and residences. But as David Schuyler shows in <em>A City Transformed,</em> redevelopment in Lancaster resulted in more failures than successes. </p><p>Beginning in the 1950s, the Lancaster Redevelopment Authority implemented a comprehensive revitalization program that changed the physical shape of the city. In attempting to solidify the retail functions of the traditional central business district, redevelopment dramatically altered key blocks of the downtown, replacing handsome turn-of-the-century Beaux Arts structures with modernist concrete boxes and a sterile public square. The strategy for eliminating density and blighted buildings resulted in the demolition of whole blocks of dwellings and, perhaps more importantly, destabilized Lancaster's African American community. </p><p><em>A City Transformed</em> is a compelling examination of a northern city struggling with its history and the legacy of segregation. But the redevelopment projects undertaken by the city, however ambitious, could not overcome the suburban growth that continues to sprawl over the countryside or the patterns of residential segregation that define city and suburb. When the Redevelopment Authority ceased operating in 1980, its legacy was a city with a declining economy, high levels of poverty and joblessness, and an increasing concentration of racial and ethnic minorities&#x2014;a city very much at risk. In important ways what happened in Lancaster was the product of federal policies and national trends. As Schuyler observes, Lancaster's experience is the nation's drama played on a local stage.</p></p><p><p>David Schuyler is Professor of American Studies at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. He is the author of <em>Apostle of Taste: Andrew Jackson Downing, 1815-1852</em> (1996) and <em>The New Urban Landscape: The Redefinition of City Form in Nineteenth-Century America</em> (1986). He serves on the editorial board of the Frederick Law Olmsted Papers project and is chair of the Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Board.</p>&#x201c;In <i>A City Transformed</i> David Schuyler offers a body of new information on the effects of urban redevelopment on a small city. The Lancaster story is important in that it mirrors the frustrated efforts of so many other cities faced with the debilitating effects of economic decline. In the end we see how such cities fumbled the ball, sacrificing so much and getting so little in return.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Christopher Silver, University of Illinois<br><br>&#x201c;Schuyler is intimately acquainted with the community, and the quality of his narrative rests upon his unrelenting scrutiny as to how Lancastrians wrangled over renewal and race. He is an omniscient observer, acutely aware of the nuances of local political culture and fluent in the argot of design, redevelopment, and the whims of architectural clients. . . . Amidst a raft of books on urban redevelopment, few are as shrewd and impassioned as this sad, familiar tale of a townscape lost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Joel Schwartz, <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography</i><br><br>&#x201c;This well-focused case study surveys how the political leadership of one city went about using, and fighting, various federal programs for replacing substandard housing, from the Depression to the suburban age.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;I. Cohen, <i>CHOICE</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>A City Transformed </i>provides a valuable complement to recent studies of comparable struggles over urban renewal in larger cities such as Minneapolis-St.Paul and Detroit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;W. Edward Orser, <i>History: Reviews of New Books</i><br><br>&#x201c;Schuyler details the travails of trying to revive a downtown in the age of the shopping mall, clearly describing the process and basic features. This case study will be more useful to more advanced students and professionals interested in comparative studies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;I. Cohen, <i>CHOICE</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>A City Transformed</i> would make an excellent reading in a course on planning history or urban studies. Policy makers would also benefit from reading the book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Tom Daniels, Professor, <i>Journal of Planning Education and Research</i><br><br>&#x201c;But these comments should not gainsay respect for an admirable account about a city that struggled against colossal metropolitan trends. Amidst a raft of books on urban redevelopment, few are as shrewd and impassioned as this sad, familiar tale of a townscape lost.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Joel Schwartz, <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography</i><br><br>&#x201c;David Schulyler&#x2019;s history of urban renewal in the age of suburbia is a well-researched and well-told story of how American city governments often applied misguided strategies with disastrous results.

Contosta, <i>Journal of American History</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>A City Transformed</i> is an important, if depressing book.

Janet Theophano shows that cookbooks provide food for the mind and soul as well. In this innovative culinary and cultural history, she explores two centuries of cookbooks and the</p><p>Beyond their recipes, what can cookbooks tell us? Much, says Janet Theophano, whose <i>Eat My Words</i> explores women's history as revealed by the cookbooks they wrote, used, or in many cases created, and through recipes, family and historical memorabilia, and other clippings. Beginning in the 17th century and bringing us to the present, Theophano examines cookbooks as repositories of female identity. Whether focusing on early English estate housekeeping books, which served as both cookbooks and primers for self-education; a 19th-century cookbook whose list of servants' tasks reveals aspects of female domestic life; or 20th-century works like Freda DeKnight's classic 1948 <i>A Date with a Dish</i>, which limns black female culture, the book, at its best, fulfills the promise of its exciting premise. But Theophano is hampered by her choice of materials. Though works like the above do tell about women's lives, others, like that of an early 20th-century Pennsylvania housewife, yield little of consequence no matter how dexterously Theophano squeezes them for meaning. This leads her into a speculative freefall and from there to overgeneralized (and often redundant) conclusions. ("Mrs. Downing gave a lot of thought to the delectable and proper meals she would serve her guests" is one of many examples.) Nonetheless, most readers will find the book an engrossing window through which to glimpse much more than how to roast a chicken or bake a cake. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>Most of us think cookbooks are just collections of recipes to feed the body. Janet Theophano shows that cookbooks provide food for the mind and soul as well. In this innovative culinary and cultural history, she explores two centuries of cookbooks and the women who wrote them--from 18th century handwritten "receipt books" to bestsellers by Alice Waters and Lynn Rossetto Kasper. Here, a cookbook is a memoir, a diary, a record of life that not only reflects ideals of family and womanhood, but also gives voice to women to express and fulfill themselves.<br></p><h2>Inside the Session: What Really Happens in Psychotherapy</h2><p>Unlike many presentations of clinical material, <i>Inside the Session</i> does not offer carefully selected examples of therapeutic dialogue that are conveniently chosen to conform to the therapist&#x2019;s views. Rather, it presents full transcripts of three entire sessions, enabling readers to see not just what went right but also where the therapist may have missed a crucial detail or may have intervened at the wrong moment. This volume provides a rare opportunity to look over the shoulder&#x2014;and into the mind&#x2014;of a renowned psychotherapist at work.<br><br> The therapist in this candid and revealing work is prolific author Paul L. Wachtel, who intersperses the sessions&#x2019; transcripts with insightful at-the-moment commentary on how to explore the client's thoughts and experiences in ways that encourage insight and promote new interpersonal patterns and on the fine points of language choice by the therapist.<br><br> A further illuminating feature of the book is an integrative framework that links the clinical work and the theoretical discussion. Wachtel&#x2019;s well-known integrative theory draws on psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, systemic, and experiential perspectives, highlighting convergences that are obscured by different terminologies and clarifying where the differences are real and important.</p><p><b>Paul L. Wachtel, PhD</b>, is a distinguished professor in the doctoral program in clinical psychology at City College of New York and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He did his undergraduate work at Columbia University; received his PhD in clinical psychology from Yale University; and is a graduate of the postdoctoral psychoanalytic training program at New York University, where he is also on the faculty.<br> &nbsp;<br> He is internationally recognized as an innovator in the field of psychotherapy and for his contributions to the application of psychological theory and research to the pressing social problems of our times.<br> &nbsp;<br> A cofounder of the Society for the Exploration of Psychotherapy Integration, Dr. Wachtel is the author of many books on psychotherapy, personality dynamics, and psychologically oriented social criticism, including <i>Action and Insight; The Poverty of Affluence; Family Dynamics in Individual Psychotherapy; Therapeutic Communication; Psychoanalysis, Behavior Therapy, and the Relational World; Race in the Mind of America: Breaking the Vicious Circles Between Blacks and Whites; </i>and, most recently,<i> Relational Theory and the Practice of Psychotherapy</i>. A number of his books have been widely described as classics in the field.<br> &nbsp;Inside the Session<br> Wachtel chose to include his commentary primarily to show, as the teaching took this book is meant to be, exactly how a therapist s mind works while he or she is in session. Textbook examples disregard this as well, choosing to write their final, polished thoughts at the end of the session when everything feels like it adds up. Real life therapy, however, doesn t work that way. And real life therapy is exactly what Dr. Wachtel is working to relay to his readers. --International Journal of Psychotherapy</p><h2>Analytics, Data Science, &amp; Artificial Intelligence: Systems for Decision Support</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in decision support systems, computerized decision-making tools, and management support systems.<br> </i> <b> <br>Market-leading guide to modern analytics, for better business decisions<br> </b> <b> <i>Analytics, Data Science, &amp; Artificial Intelligence: Systems for Decision Support</i> </b> is the most comprehensive introduction to technologies collectively called <i>analytics</i> (or <i>business analytics</i>) and the fundamental methods, techniques, and software used to design and develop these systems.

Drawing on archives, published sources, and interviews, the author situates work on the genetic code (1953-70) within the history of life science, the rise of communication technosciences (cybernetics, information theory, and computers), the intersection of molecular biology with cryptanalysis and linguistics, and the social history of postwar Europe and the United States. Kay draws out the historical specificity in the process by which the central biological problem of DNA-based protein synthesis came to be metaphorically represented as an information code and a writing technology&#x2014;and consequently as a &#x201c;book of life.&#x201d; Deploying analyses of language, cryptology, and information theory, the author persuasively argues that, technically speaking, the genetic code is not a code, DNA is not a language, and the genome is not an information system (objections voiced by experts as early as the 1950s). Thus her historical reconstruction and analyses also serve as a critique of the new genomic biopower. Genomic textuality has become a fact of life, a metaphor literalized, she claims, as human genome projects promise new levels of control over life through the meta-level of information: control of the word (the DNA sequences) and its editing and rewriting. But the author shows how the humbling limits of these scriptural metaphors also pose a challenge to the textual and material mastery of the genomic &#x201c;book of life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;[Who Wrote the Book of Life] offers a convincing and historically rich analysis of the origins and ongoing negotiations involved in the production of the genetic code. . . .

Its capacity to seek knowledge and form generalized concepts is boundless. In this ground-breaking new study, Semir Zeki explores the enormously elegant and efficient machinery of the brain to analyze its products in creative disciplines and discover whether or not this intricate system brings different solutions to bear in solving problems in disparate fields. <p><i>Splendors and Miseries of the Brain,</i> which is derived from Balzac's novel of the same name, delves into the brain's key functions of obtaining knowledge and forming concepts about the world. While these functions have been more thoroughly documented in neurobiology's traditional disciplines&#x2015;physiology, anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology, mathematics, and computer science, to name but a few&#x2015;Zeki goes beyond these fields to scientifically study the products of the brain in literature, music, art, and other fields. By studying these fields, Zeki shows that we can reach important conclusions about how the brain functions and its common processes. He also examines the heavy price to be paid in terms of human happiness that comes with the exquisite capacity of the brain and shows how misery can ultimately be turned to advantage, due to its intimate link to creativity.</p><b>Semir Zeki</b> is a visual neurobiologist in the Department of Cognitive Neurology at University College London.

He has published extensively in his field, including the books <i>Inner Vision: an exploration of art and the brain </i>(1999) and <i>A Vision of the Brain</i> (Blackwell Scientific, Oxford), and has also co-authored a book with the late French painter Balthus, entitled <i>La Qu�te de l&#x2019;essentiel</i> (1995).</p><h2>The Shadow of Imana: Travels in the Heart of Rwanda</h2><p>"I have not recovered from Rwanda. Rwanda cannot be exorcised. Danger is ever-present, lurking in the memory, crouching in the bush in neighbouring countries. Violence it still there, on every side." V�ronique Tadjo<p> As evidence emerged of the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, the outside world reeled in shock. What could have motivated these individual and collective acts of evil? In 1998, V�ronique Tadjo traveled to Rwanda to try to find out. She started with the premise that what happened in Rwanda concerns us all: "We need to understand. Our humanity is in peril."</p><p> <i>The Shadow of Imana</i> is a reminder that humankind the world over is capable of genocide. Records of what the author saw&#x2014;sites of massacres, corpses, weapons dumps&#x2014;are combined with personal stories of traumatized returnees, bereaved survivors, rape victims, orphans, lawyers faced with the impossible task of doing justice, prisoners. But Tadjo's story goes beyond mere reportage of death and cruelty. Her poetically wrought account incorporates traditional tales, explores the spiritual legacy of the genocide, and uncovers a healing vitality as well as a commitment to forgiveness.</p><p> V�ronique Tadjo was born in Paris and grew up in C�te d'Ivoire. <i>The Shadow of Imana</i> has been translated from the French by V�ronique Wakerley.</p><p> <b>Table of Contents</b></p><p> The First Journey</p><p> The Wrath of the Dead</p><p> His Voice</p><p> Anastase and Anastasie</p><p> Those Who Were Not There</p><p> The Second Journey</p></p><p>Veronique Tadjo is a writer, illustrator and painter from Cote d&#39;Ivoire.

Her view of exhibitions as interactive, emotional, embodied, imaginative experiences opens a new vista for those designing them. Using examples both from her own work at the Boston Children&#x2019;s Museum and from other institutions around the globe, Bedford offers the museum professional a bold new vision built around narrative, imagination, and aesthetics, merging the work of the educator with that of the artist. It is important reading for all museum professionals.</p><p>Leslie Bedford is a museum consultant who consults on exhibition and professional development in the US and abroad. She is a member of The Museum Group and former Director of the Leadership in Museum Education Program at the Bank Street Graduate School of Education. Bedford holds a Ph.D. in Museum Studies from Union Institute and a masters of education from Harvard. She previously worked at the Brooklyn Historical Society and the Boston Children&#x2019;s Museum. Her writings have appeared in Curator, Exhibitionist and other key museum publications. In addition to having been a Senior Fulbright Research Scholar in Japan and later Argentina, she received the Ida Karp Award from the Bank Street Alumni Association.&#x201c;The term &#x201c;page-turner&#x201d; does not come up often in reference to the literature of museum studies, but <i><b>The Art of Museum Exhibitions</b></i> is one such rare example. In her poetic and substantive new book, Bedford builds a case for the museum exhibition as an art form using essential concepts in progressive, aesthetic, and imaginative education. By bringing to life examples from across museum types, the author convincingly argues that it is the aesthetic qualities of exhibitions&#x2014;more so than their educational content&#x2014;that create lasting memories and significant meaning for visitors.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;Ben Garcia, Head of Interpretation, Hearst Museum of Anthropology, UC Berkeley<br><br>&#x201c;Leslie Bedford has provided the museum field with a much-needed analysis for a theory of exhibition development written in a personal, accessible style suitable for a wide audience.&nbsp; Her provocative argument for exhibition development as an art form that relies heavily on imagination is supported by a careful analysis of a wide-ranging literature as well as her own experience, and documented by reference to successful exhibitions in an international range of museums.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2015;George E. Hein, Professor Emeritus, Lesley University<br><br>&#x201c;What makes a museum experience magical? Leslie Bedford shines a light on the importance of imagination, narrative and aesthetic experiences&#x2015;and if you care about creating transformative exhibitions, you&#x2019;ll take her insights to heart.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2015;Lauri Halderman, Senior Director of Exhibition Interpretation, American Museum of Natural History<br><br>&#x201c;[Bedford] provide us with a well-reasoned, thoughtful analysis&nbsp; of the ways people experience the world, and uses that analysis to make a convincing argument for shifting the way museum&nbsp; professionals think about and&nbsp; create exhibitions....Before I had even finished reading, I recommended the book to several colleagues who were struggling with didactic and cumbersome exhibitions, and they found it both provocative and helpful....Most importantly, she gently persuades us that creating exhibitions is, indeed, an art.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;Kathleen McLean, <i>Exhibitionist</i></p><h2>Salesforce Service Cloud For Dummies</h2><p><b>Learn how to provide top-grade customer service anywhere, anytime with Salesforce Service Cloud</b> <p>Salesforce Service Cloud empowers your service organization to interact with customers through any channel and provide an individualized experience that will be worth sharing&#x2014;for your customers and for your company. <i>Salesforce Service Cloud For Dummies</i> is one the first books to focus specifically on Salesforce Service Cloud software.

But a farce that repeats itself ends up making a history.&#x2015;from <i>The Agony of Power</i></p><p>In these previously unpublished manuscripts written just before his death in 2007, Jean Baudrillard takes a last crack at the bewildering situation currently facing us as we exit the system of &#x201c;domination&#x201d; (based on alienation, revolt, revolution) and enter a world of generalized &#x201c;hegemony&#x201d; in which everyone becomes both hostage and accomplice of the global market. But in the free-form market of political and sexual liberation, as the possibility of revolution (and our understanding of it) dissipates, Baudrillard sees the hegemonic process as only beginning. Once expelled, negativity returns from within ourselves as an antagonistic force&#x2015;most vividly in the phenomenon of terrorism, but also as irony, mockery, and the symbolic liquidation of all human values. This is the dimension of hegemony marked by an unbridled circulation&#x2015;of capital, goods, information, or manufactured history&#x2015;that is bringing the very concept of exchange to an end and pushing capital beyond its limits: to the point at which it destroys the conditions of its own existence. In the system of hegemony, the alienated, the oppressed, and the colonized find themselves on the side of the system that holds them hostage. In this paradoxical moment in which history has turned to farce, domination itself may appear to have been a lesser evil.This book gathers together three essays&#x2015;&#x201c;From Domination to Hegemony,&#x201d; "The White Terror of World Order," and "Where Good Grows"&#x2015;and a 2005 interview with Baudrillard by Sylv�re Lotringer. Semiotext(e) launched Baudrillard into English back in the early 1980s; now, as our media and information infested &#x201c;ultra-reality&#x201d; finally catches up with his theory, Semiotext(e) offers <i>The Agony of Power</i>, Baudrillard's unsettling coda.</p></p><p>Jean Baudrillard (1929&#x2013;2007) was a philosopher, sociologist, cultural critic, and theorist of postmodernity who challenged all existing theories of contemporary society with humor and precision. An outsider in the French intellectual establishment, he was internationally renowned as a twenty-first century visionary, reporter, and provocateur.</p><h2>For What Tomorrow . . .: A Dialogue (Cultural Memory in the Present)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;For what tomorrow will be, no one knows,&#x201d; writes Victor Hugo.</p> <p>This dialogue, proposed to Jacques Derrida by the historian Elisabeth Roudinesco, brings together two longtime friends who share a common history and an intellectual heritage. While their perspectives are often different, they have many common reference points: psychoanalysis, above all, but also the authors and works that have come to be known outside France as &#x201c;post-structuralist.&#x201d; </p> <p>Beginning with a revealing glance back at the French intellectual scene over the past forty years, Derrida and Roudinesco go on to address a number of major social and political issues. Their extraordinarily wide-ranging discussion covers topics such as immigration, hospitality, gender equality, and &#x201c;political correctness&#x201d;; the disordering of the traditional family, same-sex unions, and reproductive technologies; the freedom of the &#x201c;subject&#x201d; over and against &#x201c;scientism&#x201d;; violence against animals; the haunting specter of communism and revolution; the present and future of anti-Semitism (as well as that which marked Derrida&#x2019;s own history) and the hazardous politics of criticizing the state of Israel; the principled abolition of the death penalty; and, to conclude, a chapter &#x201c;in praise of psychoanalysis.&#x201d; </p> <p>These exchanges not only help to situate Derrida's thought within the milieu out of which it grew, they also show more clearly than ever how this thought, impelled by a deep concern for justice, can be brought to bear on the social and political issues of our day. What emerges here above all, far from an abstract, apolitical discourse, is a call to take responsibility&#x2015;for the inheritance of a past, for the singularities of the present, and for the unforeseeable tasks of the future.</p></p><p>Jacques Derrida was Director of Studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and Professor of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine.

But in the 1950s the cry "Down with triangles!" was heard in France and new geometry books appeared, packed with linear algebra but with no diagrams. Was this the new right approach? Or was the right approach still something else, perhaps transformation groups?</p> <p></p> <p>The Four Pillars of Geometry approaches geometry in four different ways, spending two chapters on each. This makes the subject accessible to readers of all mathematical tastes, from the visual to the algebraic. Not only does each approach offer a different view; the combination of viewpoints yields insights not available in most books at this level. For example, it is shown how algebra emerges from projective geometry, and how the hyperbolic plane emerges from the real projective line.</p> <p></p> <p>The author begins with Euclid-style construction and axiomatics, then proceeds to linear algebra when it becomes convenient to replace tortuous arguments with simple calculations. Next, he uses projective geometry to explain why objects look the way they do, as well as to explain why geometry is entangled with algebra. And lastly, the author introduces transformation groups---not only to clarify the differences between geometries, but also to exhibit geometries that are unexpectedly the same.</p> <p></p> <p>All readers are sure to find something new in this attractive text, which is abundantly supplemented with figures and exercises.

Investigating a set of responses to the growing urban unrest in the developed and developing worlds, Scott revisits an era when the discipline of architecture staked out a role in global environmental governance and the biopolitical management of populations. She describes architecture's response to the displacement of persons brought on by migration, urbanization, environmental catastrophe, and warfare, and she traces architecture's relationship to the material, environmental, psychological, and geopolitical transformations brought on by postindustrial technologies and neoliberal capitalism after World War II.</p><p>At the height of the U.S.-led war in Vietnam and Cambodia, with ongoing decolonization struggles in many parts of the world, architecture not only emerged as a target of political agitation because of its inherent normativity but also became heavily enmeshed with military, legal, and humanitarian apparatuses, participating in scientific and technological research dedicated to questions of international management and security. Once architecture became aligned with a global matrix of forces concerned with the environment, economic development, migration, genocide, and war, its role shifted at times toward providing strategic expertise for institutions born of neoliberal capitalism. Scott investigates this nexus and questions how and to what ends architecture and the environment came to be intimately connected to the expanded exercise of power within the shifting geopolitical frameworks at this time.</p></p><p>Felicity D. Scott is Associate Professor of Architecture at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, where she directs the PhD program in architecture and codirects the program in Critical, Curatorial and Conceptual Practices in Architecture. She is the author of <i>Architecture or Techno-utopia: Politics after Modernism</i> (MIT Press).<p><i>Outlaw Territories</i> mines architectural history to generate a new sensibility and inaugurate a necessary field of practice that might be called 'the architecture of the earth.' Felicity Scott redefines architecture's task as the entanglement of politics and the environment on multiple scales: from ecological experimentation on the scale of buildings she moves on to discuss the apartheid urbanisms of segregated cities, the 'human dumping grounds' of extraterritorial zones, the 'outlawed frontiers' of deserts, oceans and forests before helping us think architecture at the scale of the earth which alternately appears as a battle-zone, a construction site and a ruin. This book is a major contribution by one of the most creative, lucid and influential of today's architectural scholars.</p>&#x2015;<b>Eyal Weizman</b>, Professor of Spatial and Visual Culture, Goldsmiths College, University of London, and author of <i>Forensic Architecture and The Least of All Possible Evils</i><br><br><p>In Scott's critically game-changing study, <i>securitas</i>&#x2015;a great political philology of the times that denotes the risk society as well as societies of care, of sovereign borders, of surveillant skies, and of fortress architecture&#x2015;is posed against outlaw territories and countercultural settlement movements in the wake of the Cold War. Scott gives us a way to think the politics of architecture as a new environmentality. Essential reading for anyone with activist stakes in the contemporary history of insurgent habitats and militarized space.</p>&#x2015;<b>Emily Apter</b>, Professor of French and Comparative Literature, New York University, and author of <i>Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability</i><br><br><p>Like an antidote to amnesia, Scott's meticulous, granular research vividly recreates the political weather of the 1970s. Here is a sidelined architecture history that returns as a missing link&#x2015;eccentric stories in the emerging development of those networks, technologies, media, and advocacies of global governance that are of most consequence today. The episodes in <i>Outlaw Territories</i>, laced with issues of militarism, security, and environment, are rehearsals for urgent spatial activism in the present.</p>&#x2015;<b>Keller Easterling</b>, Professor, Yale University, and author of <i>Extrastatecraft: The Power of Infrastructure Space</i></p><h2>Orientalism and Religion: Post-Colonial Theory, India and &#34;The Mystic East&#34;</h2><p><em>Orientalism and Religion</em> offers us a timely discussion of the implications of contemporary post-colonial theory for the study of religion. Richard King examines the way in which notions such as mysticism, religion, Hinduism and Buddhism are taken for granted. He shows us how religion needs to be reinterpreted along the lines of cultural studies. Drawing on a variety of post-structuralist and post-colonial thinkers, such as Foucault, Gadamer, Said, and Spivak, King provides us with a challenging series of reflections on the nature of Religious Studies and Indology.</p><p>Richard King teaches Religious Studies at the University of Stirling. He is the author of <em>Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism</em>."Richard King's Orentalism and Religion" is an impressive and truly cross-disciplinary study that tackles head on some of the field's most deeply ingrained yet troublesome presumptions.

It's nothing new. Just look at any of the breakthrough business ideas of the last thirty years-from Federal Express overnight delivery to Saturn's fixed sticker price-and you'll see a perfect example of the principle of disruption in action.<br> Still, do you really understand what makes these ideas great? On an intuitive level, maybe, but can you articulate it clearly, reproduce it to create your own business breakthroughs, and make it an integral part of how your company operates? Probably not-unless, of course, you're already familiar with the principles and practices spelled out in Disruption, the groundbreaking new book by global advertising and marketing authority Jean-Marie Dru.<br> To put it simply, disruption is about uncovering the culturally embedded biases and conventions that shape standard approaches to business thinking and get in the way of clear, creative thinking. It's about shattering those biases and conventions and setting creativity free to forge a radical new vision of a product, brand, or service. It's about spearheading change rather than reacting to it.<br> In Disruption, Dru shows you how to harness the enormous potential of this concept. He introduces innovative strategies for breaking down creative barriers and shows you how to analyze traditional approaches from new perspectives. Next, he provides valuable tools for identifying and cataloging conventions, including "what if," "multicultural analysis," and the "disruption bank." He then demonstrates-with the help of dozens of galvanizing examples from around the world-how to apply this knowledge systematically to create innovative competitive strategies, marketing campaigns, and operations plans that can revitalize your company or department.<br> Disruption is must reading for all advertising and marketing professionals, as well as business people who understand the value of creativity.<br> Praise for Disruption<br> "Dru offers not just a convincing context but a successful methodology for breaking out of creative ruts. There's nothing like stirring up a little turbulence to get new thoughts flying. In this book, Dru tells how to pump new energy into brands, with fresh, even revolutionary thinking." -Aldo Papone Senior Advisor, American Express Company<br> "Dru's advertising theories in Disruption are nontraditional, which is exactly what you need to regain the interest and trust of today's consumers." -Scott Bedbury Senior Vice President, Marketing, Starbucks Coffee Company<br> "Disruption is all about risk-taking, trusting your intuition, and rejecting the way things are supposed to be. Disruption goes way beyond advertising, it forces you to think about where you want your brand to go and how to get there." -Richard Branson Founder and Chairman of Virgin Group of Companies.<br> "I read Disruption with admiration and recognition. The neat marketing premise of disruption, as articulated, is brilliant. The case studies are compelling . . . making this an unusually easy read." -Owen J. Lipstein Editor-in-Chief, Psychology Today, Spy, Mother Earth News.<br> "I enjoyed reading Jean-Marie Dru's book and found myself nodding my head rather than nodding off. It's a timely and well-argued reminder of the need to be different." -David Abbott Chairman, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO Ltd.<br> "Dru offers a truly absorbing compendium of the what, how, and why of creating advertising that takes consumers by surprise-advertising that is different but effective. He offers a distinctive approach to discovering unconventional but sensible ideas for brands and for the advertising that supports them -in print, TV, or the Internet." -Stephen A. Greyser Professor of Marketing/Communications, Harvard Business School.<br> "Disruption is a catalyst of the imagination, an invaluable guide for rejecting conventionality, ideas which have always been at the heart of MTV." -Bill Roedy CEO, MTV International</p><p><i>Disruption: Overturning Conventions and Shaking Up the Marketplace</i> is veteran advertising industry executive Jean-Marie Dru's iconoclastic proposal for replacing business-as-usual advertising and marketing philosophies with radical new thinking. He contends that this shift in thought will better position new and established products, brands, and services for the competitive battles to come. Dozens of laudable examples--from Oil of Olay and FedEx to TAG Heuer and Saturn--are fully examined, and suggestions for successfully employing their techniques are offered.Disruption offers a strategy that breaks down creative barriers and has proven effective with a diverse range of clients. What disruption means is to literally destroy the traditional way of advertising a product and create an entirely new vision in the wake of this destruction. After scrutinizing the traditional approach from three perspectives--the consumer&#39;s, the client&#39;s, and the ad agency&#39;s--the method then shatters that convention and shows how to build an entirely new vision from the ashes. Proven effective in the trenches of the ad world, Disruption offers a powerful strategy for dramatic improvement. Includes examples from well-known ad campaigns from around the world, including Oil of Olay, Apple Computers, Ikea, and Jell-o. Offers an innovative concept that can be affective not only in advertising but in business in general.</p><h2>Event Marketing: How to Successfully Promote Events, Festivals, Conventions, and Expositions</h2><p><b>A modern, completely updated guide to effective event marketing</b> <p>As the events market becomes increasingly saturated, it is essential for a successful event professional to understand the use of strategic marketing plans.

All topics throughout the book are treated with zero tolerance for unrevealing definitions and for proofs which leave the reader in the dark. Some areas of particular interest are: an extremely short derivation of the ellipticity of planetary orbits; a statement and an explanation of the &#34;tennis racket paradox&#34;; a heuristic explanation (and a rigorous treatment) of the gyroscopic effect; a revealing equivalence between the dynamics of a particle and statics of a spring; a short geometrical explanation of Pontryagin&#39;s Maximum Principle, and more. In the last chapter, aimed at more advanced readers, the Hamiltonian and the momentum are compared to forces in a certain static problem. This gives a palpable physical meaning to some seemingly abstract concepts and theorems. With minimal prerequisites consisting of basic calculus and basic undergraduate physics, this book is suitable for courses from an undergraduate to a beginning graduate level, and for a mixed audience of mathematics, physics and engineering students. Much of the enjoyment of the subject lies in solving almost 200 problems in this book.</p><p>Mark Levi, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USAOne of the most valuable aspects of the book -- unfortunately rare among textbooks -- is that we see an author in command of his subject who shares not just the bare facts but how he thinks about them and how all the pieces fit together. --Mathematical Association of America<br><br>How do you write a textbook on classical mechanics that is fun to learn from? Mark Levi shows us the way with his new book: "Classical Mechanics with Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control: An Intuitive Introduction." The combination of his unique point of view with his physical and geometrical insights and numerous instructive examples, figures and problem sets make it a pleasure to work through. --Paul Rabinowitz, University of Wisconsin<br><br>It is hard to imagine a more original and insightful approach to classical mechanics. Most physicists would regard this as a well-worn and settled subject. But Mark Levi's treatment sparkles with freshness in the many examples he treats and his unexpected analogies, as well as the new approach he brings to the principles. This is inspired pedagogy at the highest level. --Michael Berry, Bristol University, UK</p><h2>Urban Outcasts: A Comparative Sociology of Advanced Marginality</h2><p>Breaking with the exoticizing cast of public discourse and conventional research, <i>Urban Outcasts</i> takes the reader inside the black ghetto of Chicago and the deindustrializing banlieue of Paris to discover that urban marginality is not everywhere the same. Drawing on a wealth of original field, survey and historical data, Lo�c Wacquant shows that the involution of America's urban core after the 1960s is due not to the emergence of an 'underclass', but to the joint withdrawal of market and state fostered by public policies of racial separation and urban abandonment. In European cities, by contrast, the spread of districts of 'exclusion' does not herald the formation of ghettos. It stems from the decomposition of working-class territories under the press of mass unemployment, the casualization of work and the ethnic mixing of populations hitherto segregated, spawning urban formations akin to 'anti-ghettos'. <p>Comparing the US 'Black Belt' with the French 'Red Belt' demonstrates that state structures and policies play a decisive role in the articulation of class, race and place on both sides of the Atlantic. It also reveals the crystallization of a new regime of marginality fuelled by the fragmentation of wage labour, the retrenchment of the social state and the concentration of dispossessed categories in stigmatized areas bereft of a collective idiom of identity and claims-making. These defamed districts are not just the residual 'sinkholes' of a bygone economic era, but also the incubators of the precarious proletariat emerging under neoliberal capitalism.<br> <br> <i>Urban Outcasts</i> sheds new light on the explosive mix of mounting misery, stupendous affluence and festering street violence resurging in the big cities of the First World. By specifying the different causal paths and experiential forms assumed by relegation in the American and the French metropolis, this book offers indispensable tools for rethinking urban marginality and for reinvigorating the public debate over social inequality and citizenship at century's dawn.</p></p><p><b>Lo�c Wacquant</b> is Professor of Sociology at the University of California-Berkeley and Researcher at the Centre de sociologie europ�enne-Paris."This is a fantastic book that anyone interested in the historical trajectory of advanced capitalism and the marginality it breeds should read. The book's real strength is its fusion of political sociological theory, economic history and a rich, everyday ethnography ... Wacquant's political sociological method is the perfect complement to recent urban geographical scholarship that deconstructs the spatial political economy of 'neoliberal urbanism', opening up the impacts of these policies on the ground with surgical precision."<br><i><b>Area</b></i> <p> "This book should be mandatory reading for scholars, graduate students and advanced undergraduates interested in this subject ... this is an exciting book written by one of the most prominent urban sociologists today. It provides a useful concept for understanding urban poverty (i.e. advanced marginality), outlines a powerful argument for how advanced marginality varies in different countries and, most importantly, identifies the power of states to shape the structure of these places and the life-chances of their residents."<br><i><b>Urban Studies</b></i></p> <p> "Leading Chicago sociology Loic Wacquant's comparative analysis of advanced marginality in the American ghetto and French banlieue is the best of a spate of works on urban poverty to be released recently."<br><i><b>Sociology</b></i></p> <p> "A thoroughly researched manifesto for an urban sociology that empowers the new precarious labour force of the post-industrial city."<br><i><b>Race and Class</b></i></p> <p> "[Wacquant] raises a series of valuable discussion points on methodology, scales of explanation, the value and challenges of comparative study, modes of writing, and the question of the author's positionality and its effects on the drama he is recounting - a rich harvest to garner from a single volume ... would make first-rate reading and discussion material for senior undergraduate and graduate seminars."<br><i><b>Annals of the Association of American Geographers</b></i></p> "<i>Urban Outcasts</i> is a majestic synthesis of research on urban marginality in advanced capitalist countries. It uncovers the common forces leading to a new kind of poverty on both sides of the Atlantic while forcefully demonstrating the distinctly different ways social exclusion operates in Europe and in America. This refreshingly new look at the nexus of race, class and space in the post-Fordist world is a major contribution to social theory and urban studies."<br> <b>Ivan Szelenyi, author of <i>Cities After Socialism and Patterns of Exclusion</i></b> <p> "In this impressive book, Wacquant deploys his unparalleled knowledge of the black American ghetto and the French <i>banlieue</i> to tackle a series of foundational questions about inequality and poverty. He shows us the variable ways in which these two conditions get constituted in two strands of capitalism and how 'territorial stigmatization' affects both the strategies of the poor and the public policies aimed at their reserved zones. The result is a provocative analysis of polarization from below and of the lived realities of urban marginality."<br> <b>Saskia Sassen, author of <i>The Global City</i> and <i>Territory, Authority, Rights</i></b></p></p><h2>Power in Practice: Adult Education and the Struggle for Knowledge and Power in Society</h2><p>"The single most important contribution to our field's knowledgebase in the past two decades.

After all, how can anyone warm to a force that cannot be seen or touched? But for two women, separated by time and space but joined in their passion for Newtonian physics, the intellectual power of that force drove them to great achievements. Brilliant, determined, and almost entirely self-taught, they dedicated their lives to explaining and disseminating Newton's discoveries.<br><br>Robyn Arianrhod's <em>Seduced by Logic</em> tells the story of Emilie du Chatelet and Mary Somerville, who, despite living a century apart, were connected by their love for mathematics and their places at the heart of the most advanced scientific society of their age. When Newton published his revolutionary theory of gravity, in his monumental Principia of 1687, most of his Continental peers rejected it for its reliance on physical observation and mathematical insight instead of religious or metaphysical hypotheses. But the brilliant French aristocrat and intellectual Emilie du Chatelet and some of her early eighteenth-century Enlightenment colleagues--including her lover, Voltaire--realized the Principia had changed everything, marking the beginning of theoretical science as a predictive, quantitative, and secular discipline. Emilie devoted herself to furthering Newton's ideas in France, and her translation of the Principia is still the accepted French version of this groundbreaking work. Almost a century later, in Scotland, Mary Somerville taught herself mathematics and rose from genteel poverty to become a world authority on Newtonian physics. She was f�ted by the famous French Newtonian, Pierre Simon Laplace, whose six-volume Celestial Mechanics was considered the greatest intellectual achievement since the Principia. Laplace's work was the basis of Mary's first book, Mechanism of the Heavens; it is a bittersweet irony that this book, written by a woman denied entry to university because of her gender, remained an advanced university astronomy text for the next century. <br><br>Combining biography, history, and popular science, <em>Seduced by Logic</em> not only reveals the fascinating story of two incredibly talented women, but also brings to life a period of dramatic political and scientific change. With lucidity and skill, Arianrhod explains the science behind the story, and explores - through the lives of her protagonists - the intimate links between the unfolding Newtonian revolution and the development of intellectual and political liberty.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robyn Arianrhod</strong> is an Honorary Research Associate in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Monash University.

In this new consumer society, individuals become simultaneously the promoters of commodities and the commodities they promote. They are, at one and the same time, the merchandise and the marketer, the goods and the travelling salespeople. They all inhabit the same social space that is customarily described by the term the market. <br> <p>The test they need to pass in order to acquire the social prizes they covet requires them to recast themselves as products capable of drawing attention to themselves. This subtle and pervasive transformation of consumers into commodities is the most important feature of the society of consumers. It is the hidden truth, the deepest and most closely guarded secret, of the consumer society in which we now live.</p> <p>In this new book Zygmunt Bauman examines the impact of consumerist attitudes and patterns of conduct on various apparently unconnected aspects of social life politics and democracy, social divisions and stratification, communities and partnerships, identity building, the production and use of knowledge, and value preferences.<br> </p> <p>The invasion and colonization of the web of human relations by the worldviews and behavioural patterns inspired and shaped by commodity markets, and the sources of resentment, dissent and occasional resistance to the occupying forces, are the central themes of this brilliant new book by one of the worlds most original and insightful social thinkers.</p></p><p><b>Zygmunt Bauman</b> (1925-2017) was Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the Universities of Leeds and Warsaw."[An] engaged and important antidote to the platitudes of the times ... encourages the very human virtues [Bauman seeks] to recover from a world otherwise only concerned with the easy, the simple and the fast."<br><b><i>Times Higher Education </i></b> <p>"A masterful account and critique of consumerism and the social consequences of its ubiquity ... another worthy contribution to the urgent task of social critique amid unprecedented and unfettered consumerism."<b><i><br>Sociology</i></b></p> <p>"A timely intervention in helping sociologists think about what the sociology of consumption has achieved."<b><i><br>Sociological Review</i></b></p> <p>"<i>Consuming Life</i> provides a fiery, stimulating and sharp diagnosis, with much to tell us about where and who we are in a market-led society."<br><i><b>Commentary<br></b></i><br>"Bauman's message calls for awakening from the slumber we are in."<br><i><b>Essays in Philosophy</b></i></p></p><h2>Sports Economics</h2><p>Sports Economics, the most comprehensive textbook in the field by celebrated economist Roger D.

It employs the basic principles of economics to address issues such as the organization of leagues, pricing, advertising, and broadcasting as well as the labor market in sports. Among its novel features is the candid coverage of the image and integrity of players, teams, managers, and the leagues themselves, including cases of gambling, cheating, misconduct, and steroids. The text also discusses other controversial subjects such as disciplining participants, discrimination, the financing of facilities, and how salaries are determined. Blair explains how economic decisions are made under conditions of uncertainty using the well-known expected utility model and makes extensive use of present value concepts to analyze investment decisions. Numerous examples are drawn from the daily press. The text offers ample boxes to illustrate sports themes, as well as extensive use of diagrams, tables, problem sets, and research questions.</p><p>Sports Economics, the most comprehensive textbook in the field by celebrated economist Roger D.
